## Development Tools
--------------------

If you would like to build your own copy of Athenz rather than
using the pre-built binary packages, then here is the list of
development tools you need to have installed on your system.

### Java Platform JDK 8
-----------------------

To build Athenz components, you must have Java Platform JDK 8 installed
on your machine. The main authorization services - ZMS and ZTS, are
written in Java and using embedded Jetty.

[Oracle Java Platform JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

Athenz has been developed and tested with Oracle Java Platform JDK 8.
However, it should compile and run without any issues with OpenJDK 8 as well.

Make sure you have set the $JAVA_HOME environment variable.

### Maven
---------

Download and install [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

### Git Client
--------------

If you don't have git client installed on your host, you can download
one from [Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads). 2.x version of
the git client is required.

### Go
------

Install go by following the directions at
[Getting Started - The Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/doc/install).

Make sure you have set the [$GOPATH environment variable](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-GOPATH_environment_variable) and that you have `$GOPATH/bin` in your `$PATH`.

### Node JS
-----------

Install node by following the directions at
[Node.js JavaScript Runtime](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Verify that you have the required minimum version of `node` and
`nodemon` binaries installed on your system and are included
in your runtime path:

```shell
$ node --version
v6.9.4
$ npm install -g nodemon
$ nodemon --version
1.11.0
```

## Build Steps
--------------

To build Athenz components, change to the top level directory where
Athenz code has been checked out and execute:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/AthenZ/athenz.git
$ cd athenz
$ mvn clean install
```

The release packages will be created automatically in the `assembly`
subdirectory.

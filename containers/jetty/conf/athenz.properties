# not specified, then the request will be handled by either http
# or https ports specified in the configuration. However, if this
# status port is specified and is different than the configured
# http and https ports, then /status endpoint will only be handled
# on this port and all other requests will be rejected. Similarly,
# /status endpoint will not be allowed on configured http/https
# ports. The status port will be either http or https depending
# which port is specified for data access. If both http and https
# ports are specified, https will be selected for the protocol.

The following is the list of features that the Athenz team is working or
planning to work on. At Verizon Media, we review our list every quarter
and decide which features will be implemented during that quarter. Additionally,
we implement several smaller features as they're requested by our customers.

# Q3 2021

- Micro Segmentation: Service Identity based ACLs (IP Table update)
- Extend ZMS CLI to output YAML based on server schema
- Support multi-version policies with option to specify a specific version as default/active
- Update ZTS to use its own Athenz X.509 client certificate for the instance provider callbacks
- Provide a capability to dynamically determine which roles require certificates
- UI: Allow user to configure some common settings while creating a role

# Q2 2021

- Micro Segmentation: Service Identity based ACLs (IP Table update)
- Support proxy principal support with the use Rich Authorization Request feature
- Implement an interface to allow validation and sync of domain meta fields (business service, aws account, etc)
- Support member and service auto-expiry support for groups
- Extend periodic review workflow to expose reminder date support
- Extend ZMS CLI to provide additional output formats such as JSON
- Enhance periodic review workflow to extend review reminder date standalone / in addition to expiry date wherever applicable
- UI: expose all domain / role configuration options
- UI: Apply available server templates from UI

# Q1 2021

- Deliver OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests feature based on Internet Draft
- Deliver Tag support feature for both roles and domains
- Athenz Client libraries multi-release supporting JDK 8/11
- Build and require the use of JDK 11 for server components

# Q4 2020

- Athenz Service Identity Provider for Azure to allow VMs deployed within Azure
  to have unique, short-lived identity x.509 certificates
- Extend AWS EKS service identity agent to support IRSA.
- Auto Generate API Guide based on configured RDL files.
- UI: Implement support for Principals Groups
- Implement metric notifications in addition to email ones. This would allow teams
  to look at metrics and generate alerts if their services are about to expire
  and immediate action is needed to extend their role membership.
- Introduce suspended user support in Athenz. The User Authority can mark
  a user as suspended, and the user will be automatically excluded from any
  access until the User Authority reports otherwise.
- Improve rate limiting support per principal.

# Q3 2020

- Principal Group feature. The feature allows grouping users and services
  and including those groups as principals in roles. Provides easier management
  of groups, especially from external domains (rather than using delegated roles)
- UI: Redesign Athenz UI to have better user experience when managing roles
- Lookup all roles in all domains for given principal
- Update feature documentation
- Support saving case-sensitive action/resource values in policy assertions
- Reduced Scope Service Identity Certificate Support - mark a provider service
  with this scope such that those certificates cannot be used to make changes
  in Athenz domains or request further tokens from ZTS.
- Extend User Authority Filter feature to set at a domain level

# Q2 2020

- Review Reminder (soft expiry) support for role members. The role members
  and the domain administrators still get expiry notifications, but the user
  is not expired from the role causing a service outage.
- Extend support to include additional SAN DNS values in the Service
  Identity X.509 Certificate requests.
- Support versioning of server templates. Provide support to auto-update
  all domains that have a given template applied. Update Athenz UI to
  display applied templates on a domain.
  
# Q1 2020

- Provide workflow in Athenz UI to approve role membership to satisfy
  auditing and governance requirements.
- Support self-serve and review enabled roles which would require
  2 domain administrator approvals before a member becomes active.
- Provide auto expiry support at both role and domain level with
  separate values for human users and services.
- Email notification support for any active hosts not refreshing their
  service identity certificates.

# Future

- Unix SSH Access Management solution
  - Define least privileged access policies in Athenz like who can login, sudo, what sudo commands are permitted for a given set of users, headless accounts, unix groups, headless users incoming and outgoing policies etc 
  - Provision the access policies on the target hosts in near realtime
- Athenz Integration with Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Implement SPIFEE workload API to be 100% SPIFEE spec compliant

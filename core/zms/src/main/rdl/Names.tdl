//Common name types used by several API definitions
//

//A simple identifier, an element of compound name.
type SimpleName String (pattern="[a-zA-Z0-9_][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*");

//A compound name. Most names in this API are compound names.
type CompoundName String (pattern="({SimpleName}\\.)*{SimpleName}");

//A domain name is the general qualifier prefix, as its uniqueness is managed.
type DomainName String (pattern="{CompoundName}");

//An entity name is a short form of a resource name,
//including only the domain and entity.
type EntityName String (pattern="{CompoundName}");

//A service name will generally be a unique subdomain.
type ServiceName String (pattern="{CompoundName}");

//A location name is not yet defined, but will be a 
//dotted name like everything else.
type LocationName String (pattern="{CompoundName}");

//An action (operation) name.
type ActionName String (pattern="{CompoundName}");

//A resource name
//Note that the EntityName part is optional, that is,
//a domain name followed by a colon is valid resource name.
type ResourceName String (pattern="{DomainName}(:{EntityName})?");

//The Y-specific URL-safe Base64 variant.
type YBase64 String (pattern="[a-zA-Z0-9\\._-]+");

//YEncoded includes ybase64 chars, as well as = and %.
//This can represent a user cookie and URL-encoded values.

//Used as the prefix in a signed assertion. This uniquely
//identifies a signing authority.
type AuthorityName String (pattern="{CompoundName}"); //i.e. "user"

//A signed assertion if identity. i.e. the user cookie value.
//This token will only make sense to the authority that
//generated it, so it is beneficial to have something in the
//value that is cheaply recognized to quickly reject if
//it belongs to another authority. In addition to the
//YEncoded set our token includes ; to separate components
//and , to separate roles and : for IPv6 addresses
type SignedToken String (pattern="[a-zA-Z0-9\\._%=:;,-]*");

//Role Member name - could be one of three values: *,
//DomainName.* or ServiceName[*]

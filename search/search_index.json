Athenz authorization system utilizes x.509 certificates and Access Tokens. The name \"Athenz\" is derived from \"AuthNZ\" (N for authentication and Z for authorization). It provides support for the following three major functional areas. Service Authentication \u00b6 Athenz provides secure identity in the form of short lived X.509 certificate and a certificate and IP-based distributed system to handle for every workload or service deployed in private (e.g. Openstack, K8S, Screwdriver) on-box enforcement. or public cloud (e.g. AWS EC2, ECS, Fargate, Lambda). Using these X.509 certificates clients and services establish secure connections and through mutual TLS authentication verify each other's identity. The service identity certificates are valid for 30 days only and the service identity agents (SIA) part of those frameworks automatically refresh them daily. The term service within Athenz is more generic than a traditional service. A service identity could represent a command, job, daemon, workflow, as well as both an application client and an application service. Since Athenz service authentication is based on X.509 certificates , it is important that you have a good understanding what X.509 certificates are and how they're used to establish secure connections in Internet protocols such as TLS . Role-Based Authorization (RBAC) \u00b6 Once the client is authenticated with its x.509 certificate, the service their own role-based access control systems that have no central store can then check if the given client is authorized to carry out the requested and often rely on network ACLs and manual updating. action. Athenz provides fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC) support for a centralized management system with support for control-plane access control decisions and a decentralized enforcement mechanism suitable for data-plane access control decisions. It also provides a delegated management model that supports multi-tenant and self-service concepts. AWS Temporary Credentials Support \u00b6 When working with AWS, Athenz provides support to access AWS services from on-prem services with using AWS temporary credentials rather than static credentials.

Imagine in a real world scenario if you are creating a solution for any organization(Openstack, Kubernetes) and subsequently want to set up provisioning rules(a static set of roles and policies) for the solution, rather than requiring each domain admin to create each of these roles and policies manually, you can pre-bundle the roles and policies as a template and Athenz will automatically apply them for you while creating or updating a domain. Templates \u00b6 Creating and updating templates \u00b6 All templates will be managed by the Athenz System Administrators. To create / update templates, the administrators should create a file named solution_templates.json and store it in their data repository. The file should follow the format below { \"<template_name>\": { \"metadata\": {}, \"roles\": [<athenz-roles>], \"policies\": [<athenz-policies>], \"services\": [<athenz-services>] } } A sample file can be found at servers/zms/conf/solution_templates.json Template Entities \u00b6 A Template consists of metadata, services, roles and role metadata, policies with assertions. Please find the explanation for every entity below MetaData \u00b6 Metadata contains critical fields to represent vital characteristics of a template. Look at the sample structure below for one of the templates in use. \"metadata\": { \"latestVersion\": 1, \"timestamp\": \"2020-06-16T00:00:00.000Z\", \"description\": \"Description of template\", \"keywordsToReplace\": \"_env_,_track_\", \"autoUpdate\": false } A - Description - description of the template (restrict it to 140 characters if possible) B - latestVersion - to manage versioning. Everytime there is a change in the template including a template metadata change, Make sure to bump up the latestVersion field by 1. C - Timestamp - recorded timestamp when you update(including metadata change) a template. This is purely to help you time track template changes. D - keywordsToReplace - this field is a comma separated placeholder you can add to your role/policy name which will be auto replaced on the fly. for ex: keywordsToReplace will be set to \u201c env , track \u201d for a role name \u201c domain :role.some-role. env .track. track .emitters\". You should leave keywordsToReplace field empty if you do not have any placeholders in your role or policy name. (for ex: \"keywordsToReplace\": \"\",) Note: domain is the only exception here. When applying a template to a domain, the server will automatically include the correct domain name in role/policy names by replacing the domain placeholder with the appropriate value so do not worry about adding it. Example structure of roles/policies which uses multiple placeholders: \"roles\": [ { \"name\": \"_domain_:role.some-role._env_.track._track_.emitters\", \"modified\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\" } ], \"policies\": [ { \"name\": \"_domain_:policy.some-policy._env_.track._track_.emitters\", \"modified\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\", \"assertions\": [ { \"resource\": \"some-resource._env_:role.track._track_.emitters\", \"role\": \"_domain_:role.some-role._env_.track._track_.emitters\", \"action\": \"assume_role\" } ] } ] Roles \u00b6 Roles can have attributes like name, modified timestamp, Role Meta attributes (check the complete role meta attributes list below) and roleMembers. By default roles that are created by the template will not have any members unless the role members are hard-coded in the template (check the example structure below). The domain administrator will need to add members to those roles after the domain is created or the template has been applied to a domain. Now if you notice role members array in the image below, members can also have placeholders which have to be added to keywordsToReplace. Sample structure for Roles with role members: \"roles\": [ { \"name\": \"_domain_:role.aws_instance_launch_provider\", \"modified\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\", \"roleMembers\": [ { \"memberName\": \"athens.aws.*\" } ] }, { \"name\": \"_domain_:role.aws.ssh_login\", \"modified\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\" }, { \"name\": \"_domain_:role.aws_ssh_cert_request\", \"modified\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\", \"roleMembers\": [ { \"memberName\": \"_domain_._service_\" } ] } ] Allowed Role Meta Attributes: \"selfServe\": \"false\", \"memberExpiryDays\": 90, \"tokenExpiryMins\": 30, \"certExpiryMins\": 10, \"serviceExpiryDays\": 50, \"memberReviewDays\": 65, \"serviceReviewDays\": 15, \"reviewEnabled\": true Policies \u00b6 Array of policies with name, modified timestamp and array of assertions. Check the sample Json below. \"policies\": [ { \"name\": \"_domain_:policy.aws_instance_launch_provider\", \"modified\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\", \"assertions\": [ { \"resource\": \"_domain_:service._service_\", \"role\": \"_domain_:role.aws_instance_launch_provider\", \"action\": \"launch\" } ] }, { \"name\": \"_domain_:policy.aws.ssh_login\", \"modified\": \"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\", \"assertions\": [ { \"resource\": \"_domain_:aws._service_.*\", \"role\": \"_domain_:role.aws.ssh_login\", \"action\": \"ssh_login\", \"effect\": \"DENY\" } ] } Applying Templates \u00b6 Templates can be applied via ZMS CLI and via Athenz UI. let's take a look at a few examples on how to apply different types of templates. Example 1 \u00b6 Templates with placeholders in role and policy names (aka comma separated values in keywordsToReplace under template metadata field) will have to pass the key value pair for all placeholders via CLI. However, Athenz UI will automatically detect the placeholders and prompt the user to enter those placeholder values without which you cannot apply a template CLI \u00b6 zms-cli -d some-domain set-domain-template some-template-name env=ecli track=clit UI \u00b6 Example 2 \u00b6 Templates with static role and policy names i.e. no placeholders zms-cli -d some-domain set-domain-template other-template-name UI \u00b6 The update button with blue background means there is a latest version of the template available to apply and the update button with white background means there is no new version but you can still apply if you accidentally deleted a policy or role which is part of the template and wanted to patch it up. Auto Update \u00b6 Auto update flag in templates lets the zms server to patch up the changes made to roles and policies automatically. This way the template creator does not need to communicate the tenant domains to patch them up manually through Athenz UI or CLI. AutoUpdate runs on zms servers during application startup in an uninterrupted fashion and applies roles and policies for all eligible templates. This feature will work only for templates with no placeholders at the moment i.e. the metadata section in the template should have the following values keywordsToReplace=\"\" and autoUpdate set to true. Note: it is important to bump up the latestVersion flag to apply any changes in the template including metadata changes like autoUpdate and keywordsToReplace. FAQ \u00b6 1 - What happens if i set the auto-update flag to true in template metadata but did not bump up the version? \u00b6 Auto update will not kick in if the server does not detect a version bump in the template. 2 - Is there a way to apply a template for the first time on a newly created domain in UI? \u00b6 No. you can only update a template in the UI using the apply template button. You have to apply template for the first time via Cli 3 - What happens if i pass a template name that is invalid via CLI? \u00b6 If any of the template names is invalid, the request will be rejected with a Bad Request error message indicating the invalid template name. If the template is not found, then the request will be rejected with a Not Found error message indicating the template name that\u2019s not registered in ZMS. 4 - What is the difference between current version and latest version in the UI? \u00b6 Current version is the template version already applied on your domain and the latest version is a new version that is available for you to apply. You will see a dark blue button in the UI when there is a latest version. 5 - What should i do if i deleted a role or policy which is part of a template by accident? \u00b6 Go to the UI and click on the update button(with white background if the template already has the latest version) and the roles and policies will be recreated. 6 - What if I accidentally created a bunch of roles and policies while experimenting with a template and wanted to delete it? \u00b6 One has to manually clean it up. 7 - What are the different zms-cli commands to manage templates? \u00b6 Template commands: list-server-template list-domain-template show-server-template template set-domain-template template [template ...] [param-key=param-value ...] delete-domain-template template","title":"Athenz Templates"},{"location":"athenz_templates/#introducing-athenz-templates","text":"Templates are a collection of predefined roles, policies and services that can be applied on a domain.

The diagram below shows a simplification of the use case without domain configuration. Your domain configuration file gives you fine control over who can access resources and what actions can be taken. ZMS manages your domain files and provides a RESTful API that allows you to create and modify domain configurations. This gives you the ability to control user access , tenancy , and secure editorial content and infrastructure assets . Real-Time Service Security \u00b6 Athenz provides endpoint protection for services, so a service such as Sports in the diagram below doesn't need to set network ACLs for other services wanting to access data. Instead, services are authorized by Athenz to access resources from another service based on the permissions defined by the domain administrator. Authorization Flow \u00b6 Centralized Access Control (Control-Plane) \u00b6 A traditional centralized mechanism works as expected for services that are not dealing with the decentralized authorization: the server with resources can simply ask the ZMS directly about access, passing the service identity and resource/action information to get a simple boolean answer. This does not scale well enough for data-plane access, since a central service must be consulted, but requires no local installation of the ZPE and related storage and synchronization logic. It is suitable for provisioning and configuration use cases where the number of requests processed by the server are small and the latency for authorization checks is not important. Principals \u00b6 In Athenz, actors that can assume a role are called principals. Principals can be users or services, and users can be those looking for resources from a service or use the ZMS management console. In the following sections, we'll look at centralized authorization for the service principal we just discussed. Authenticated Service \u00b6 To contact Athenz Services (ZMS/ZTS) or other Athenz Enabled services, the client service must first obtain an Athenz CA issued X.509 certificate. The services establish standard mutual TLS communication with other Athenz Enabled Services. Once the mutual TLS authentication is established, the provider service contacts Athenz Management Service directly to determine if a specific authenticated service has been authorized to carry out the given action on the requested resource. The application receives a simple boolean answer whether or not the request should be processed or rejected. The domain administrator can create a separate service that only has access for the given provider, thus provider having access to the service's identity will not have access to any other resource. Refer Service Authentication for full details on X.509 certificate based authentication. Decentralized Access Control (Data-Plane) \u00b6 A more interesting scenario introduces the local policy engine (ZPE), and a few supporting changes. Rather than directly asking for an access check with a principal identity, the identity is instead used to get a ZToken, and that is presented to the target service until it expires. This mechanism allows a service to make a completely local access check against ZPE, given a ZToken and locally cached policies. Specifically, as shown in the diagram below, the client service/user presents an X.509 certificate from SIA Provider to get an authorization token (ZToken) from ZTS, and then presents the ZToken to a target service to access its resources. That service can make use of a local ZPE to validate the role assertions in the ZToken, and then correlate them to the asynchronously updated Policies for the domain involved. The ZPE can make the decision locally, without going off box. It has no knowledge about specific users, only roles, and because roles and policies are always in the domain, the amount of data to distribute to the machine is small. Policy Engine \u00b6 The Policy Engine (ZPE) only needs to deal with policies and their roles, actions, and resources. Concepts like groups would only affect how a principal can assume a role, so is involved in getting the ZToken, but not using it in the ZPE. When evaluating policies, the relevant assertions of all relevant policies must be considered. Assertions are treated like a big \"OR\" with the default effect of \"Allow\", whereas any single \"Deny\" will override any other assertions. The policies can have prefix-matching wildcards, so that glob-style matching needs to be part of the \"is this assertion relevant\" logic. The policies must be fetched from ZTS for the ZPE to operate. Additionally, the policies must be refreshed as they change. It is expected that policies will change at a much lower frequency than user/role assignments, so a daily pull may be fine for this. The policies are not sensitive (secret) information, but their integrity is important, so the policies fetched (per domain) is signed by both ZMS and ZTS servers. This requires a predictable serialization of the policy data structures. That will be fields in the order the schema specifies, serialized to JSON, then signed. The actual fetch is performed by a locally running distribution agent, which could be implemented as a cron job or other async fetching mechanism. The resulting policies could be atomically changed per domain. Because the ZPE only will have policies for the domains of services running on the same host/container, there will be relatively few of them. The API for getting signed policies actually gets many policies in a single list, which is signed as a whole according to the ordering rules above. Reserved Domains \u00b6 The following domains are reserved and are automatically provisioned during server startup: user - The reserved domain for authenticated users. sys - The reserved domain for managing system activities sys.auth - The Athenz domain itself, which is where policies governing the top level domains reside. Management Scenarios \u00b6 Simple Centralized Scenario \u00b6 In the simplest scenario, one would perform the following actions. Note that even in this case, the management calls themselves are protected by Athenz, so for example one property admin cannot modify another property's domain. Set up domains as a super admin Assign domain administrators for the domain Create services in the domain Create roles, as the domain admin, to model the expected activity. Assign users and services as needed. Create policies, with references to resources that are the target of various actions The services would implement the access check calls to enforce access based on the ZMS \"access check\" API. This may happen in a container or filter. Multi-tenancy Scenario \u00b6 Setting up a tenant in a provider requires the concepts of a cross-domain \"trust relation\". Such a trust relation can be implemented as follows: A Policy is set up in the group-defining domain (Domain-A) that asserts that one of its local Roles can \u201cassume\u201d a role in the target Domain. The role used in this policy is arbitrary, under the control of Domain-A, who can add/remove users from it as it needs. A Role is created in the target Domain-B, but instead of specifying users, the trusted domain is set to Domain-A. Domain-B can then set up whatever policies it needs to protect relevant resources, by referring to its special role as the principal At access check time, when the policy is encountered that indicates a role that is trusted, that role (in another Domain) must then be consulted to determine who can assume the role.

This requires a predictable serialization of the policy data structures. That will be fields in the order the schema specifies, serialized to JSON, then signed. The actual fetch is performed by a locally running distribution agent, which could be implemented as a cron job or other async fetching mechanism. The resulting policies could be atomically changed per domain. Because the ZPE only will have policies for the domains of services running on the same host/container, there will be relatively few of them. The API for getting signed policies actually gets many policies in a single list, which is signed as a whole according to the ordering rules above.","title":"Policy Engine"},{"location":"auth_flow/#reserved-domains","text":"The following domains are reserved and are automatically provisioned during server startup: user - The reserved domain for authenticated users. sys - The reserved domain for managing system activities sys.auth - The Athenz domain itself, which is where policies governing the top level domains reside.","title":"Reserved Domains"},{"location":"auth_flow/#management-scenarios","text":"","title":"Management Scenarios"},{"location":"auth_flow/#simple-centralized-scenario","text":"In the simplest scenario, one would perform the following actions.

For example, your service might need to access its own S3 bucket to push some data to AWS. Instead of using an IAM user's credentials to access that S3 bucket, the administrator will define a role providing access to that S3 bucket and then configure their service to retrieve temporary session credentials for that role through ZTS Server. Connection Details \u00b6 To obtain temporary credentials, the client must contact ZTS Server running in AWS. Client X.509 Certificate Requirements \u00b6 To contact ZTS running in AWS to obtain temporary credentials, the client service must authenticate itself using Athenz issued client X.509 certificates. The steps are different depending on where your client service is running. Follow these steps to obtain a service x.509 certificate for your client service. AWS Account ID Registration \u00b6 To register an AWS Account with a domain, run the following command: zms-cli -d <domain-name> set-aws-account <aws-account-id> AWS Configuration Setup \u00b6 To obtain temporary credentials for a given role through ZTS Server, the administrator must follow through these steps: 1. You must already have a role created in AWS IAM that you would like to obtain temporary credentials for. 2. In AWS, setup a trust relationship for your role such that ZTS can assume that role. On the IAM Roles page, choose the role that you want to modify and click on the Trust Relationships tab. Click on the Edit Trust Relationship button and append the following section to the current document's Statement element (don't forget to make sure to convert the Statement element into an array and add necessary commas): { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": { \"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/athenz-zts-service\" }, \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\" } If configured correctly, the Trust Relationships tab should show athenz-zts-service as one of entries in the Trusted Entities table. Expiration Period \u00b6 AWS announced that they have extended the federated api access to AWS resources from the default 1 hour to up to 12 hours . To change the expiration period for a role, click on the Edit link in the role configuration screen in IAM and choose either one of the predefined duration or specify a custom one. Once the role is configured with a longer duration period. use the ZTS client api as described in the Obtaining AWS Temporary Credentials section to specify the requested duration for the temporary credentials. External ID Condition \u00b6 By including an external id condition in the AssumeRole policy, the account administrator secures its roles to be accessed by unauthorized principals in case ZTS has been compromised since AWS STS will reject any assume role requests unless the external id is specified as part of the request. Once an external id has been chosen, the AssumeRole policy configured for the role can be updated to include the external id condition. For example, to configure an external id hockey for our role we'll have the following policy: { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": { \"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/athenz-zts-service\" }, \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\", \"Condition\": { \"StringEquals\": { \"sts:ExternalId\": \"hockey\" } } } If configured correctly, the Trust Relationships tab should show athenz-zts-service as one of entries in the Trusted Entities table with a condition field specified. Once the role is configured with an external id condition, use the ZTS client api as described in the Obtaining AWS Temporary Credentials section to specify the external id for the temporary credentials. The external ID must be kept securely. Your application will need to fetch the external id and then use it in the API call to fetch AWS temporary credentials. Athenz AWS Assume Role Configuration Setup \u00b6 1. In ZMS, create a role in your domain with any service identities that may request temporary credentials for the AWS role. Go to Athenz UI, choose your Athenz domain and click on the Add Role link in the top left corner. 2. In ZMS, create a policy authorizing your Athenz role members to assume the AWS role. When creating the policy the action must be assume_aws_role , choose the role as created in the previous step and specify the IAM role name as the resource. 3. Make sure your role contains all the service identities that may request temporary credentials for this role. 4. The changes will propagate from ZMS to ZTS running within AWS within 2 minutes, and then you can use the ZTS Client library or its REST API to request temporary credentials. Obtaining AWS Temporary Credentials \u00b6 We're going to look at how to obtain AWS Temporary Credentials with the use of the ZTS Client Library in Java and directly with ZTS Server's REST API. By default the AWS Temporary Credentials returned are valid only for 1 hour. If configured, it can be extended upto 12 hours - see Expiration period section for full details. The client must refresh the credentials before they expire. REST API \u00b6 To obtain a AWS Temporary Credentials, the application would use the following endpoint from ZTS Server running in AWS: GET /zts/v1/domain/{domainName}/role/{awsRoleName}/creds?durationSeconds={durationSeconds}&externalId={externalId} durationSeconds and externalId query arguments are optional. For example, with our setup as described above, sherpa.api is our service identity and we have retrieved the X.509 certificate for this service. The file locations are as follows: private-key: /var/lib/sia/keys/sherpa.api.key.pem certificate: /var/lib/sia/certs/sherpa.api.cert.pem The following request would retrieve AWS temporary session credentials for the sherpa.property domain's aws IAM role s3-uploader : curl --key /var/lib/sia/keys/sherpa.api.key.pem --cert /var/lib/sia/certs/sherpa.api.cert.pem https://your.zts/zts/v1/domain/sherpa.property/role/s3-uploader/creds Note that the awsRoleName URL parameter is the name of the IAM role you want to assume, not the Athenz role created in ZMS. Expiration Period \u00b6 The following request would retrieve AWS temporary session credentials for the sherpa.property domain's aws iam role s3-uploader with duration set to 6 hours (6 * 60 * 60 = 21600 seconds): curl --key /var/lib/sia/keys/sherpa.api.key.pem --cert /var/lib/sia/certs/sherpa.api.cert.pem https://your.zts/zts/v1/domain/sherpa.property/role/s3-uploader/creds?durationSeconds=21600 External ID Condition \u00b6 If we had configured our AssumeRole policy for the s3-uploader role with an external id of hockey then our request would be: curl --key /var/lib/sia/keys/sherpa.api.key.pem --cert /var/lib/sia/certs/sherpa.api.cert.pem https://your.zts/zts/v1/domain/sherpa.property/role/s3-uploader/creds?externalId=hockey Case Sensitivity \u00b6 While object names (e.g. in your assume_aws_role policy statement) in Athenz are all normalized to lower case, role names in IAM are case sensitive . When calling ZTS to fetch temporary credentials using AssumeRole, the awsRoleName parameter must match exactly (including case) the role name configured in IAM or the request will be denied. Java \u00b6 First you need to update your Java project pom.xml file to indicate the dependency on the Athenz cert refresher and zts java client libraries. Checkout the Maven Central Athenz Cert Refresher Package and Maven Central ZTS Java Client Package pages to make sure you're using the latest release version: <dependencies> <dependency> <groupId> com.yahoo.athenz </groupId> <artifactId> athenz-zts-java-client </artifactId> <version> VERSION-NUMBER </version> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId> com.yahoo.athenz </groupId> <artifactId> athenz-cert-refresher </artifactId> <version> VERSION-NUMBER </version> </dependency> </dependencies> To obtain a AWS Temporary Credentials Provider, the application would use the following constructor: /** * Constructs a new AWSCredentialsProvider object with the given SSLContext object, * ZTS Server Url, Athenz domain name and AWS Role Name to retrieve temporary * credentials for.

The file location are as follows: private-key: /var/lib/sia/keys/sherpa.api.key.pem certificate: /var/lib/sia/certs/sherpa.api.cert.pem The ZTS server is running with a public X.509 certificate so we're going to use the standard jdk truststore for our connection which has a default password of changeit . The following request would retrieve AWS temporary session credentials for the sherpa.property domain's aws iam role s3-uploader : import javax.net.ssl.SSLContext ; import com.oath.auth.KeyRefresher ; import com.oath.auth.Utils ; import com.yahoo.athenz.zts.AWSCredentialsProviderImpl ; final String ztsUrl = \"https://your.zts/zts/v1\" ; final String keyPath = \"/var/lib/sia/keys/sherpa.api.key.pem\" ; final String certPath = \"/var/lib/sia/certs/sherpa.api.cert.pem\" ; final String trustStorePath = javaHome + \"/jre/lib/security/cacerts\" ; final String trustStorePassword = \"changeit\" ; try { // Create our SSL Context object based on our private key and // certificate and jdk truststore KeyRefresher keyRefresher = Utils . generateKeyRefresher ( trustStorePath , trustStorePassword , certPath , keyPath ); // Default refresh period is every hour. keyRefresher . startup (); // Can be adjusted to use other values in milliseconds. // keyRefresher.startup(900000); SSLContext sslContext = Utils . buildSSLContext ( keyRefresher . getKeyManagerProxy (), keyRefresher . getTrustManagerProxy ()); // obtain temporary credential provider for our domain and role // without external id and default period of 1 hour AWSCredentialsProviderImpl awsCredProvider = new AWSCredentialsProviderImpl ( ztsUrl , sslContext , \"sherpa.property\" , \"s3-uploader\" , null , null , null ); // retrieve and display aws temporary creds.

Expiration Period \u00b6 The following request would retrieve AWS temporary session credentials for the sherpa.property domain's aws iam role s3-uploader with duration set to 6 hours (6 * 60 * 60 = 21600 seconds) and a minimum timeout of 15 minutes. This indicates that the client will cache the token for 5 hours and 45 minutes. // obtain temporary credential provider for our domain and role AWSCredentialsProviderImpl awsCredProvider = new AWSCredentialsProviderImpl ( ztsUrl , sslContext , \"sherpa.property\" , \"s3-uploader\" , 900 , 21600 , null ); External ID Condition \u00b6 If we had configured our AssumeRole policy for the s3-uploader role with an external id of hockey then our request would be: // obtain temporary credential provider for our domain and role externalId = retrieveExternalIDFromYkeykey(); // would return \"hockey\" AWSCredentialsProviderImpl awsCredProvider = new AWSCredentialsProviderImpl(ztsUrl, sslContext, \"sherpa.property\", \"s3-uploader\", null, null, externalId); Go \u00b6 To obtain a AWS Temporary Credentials, the application would use the Athenz ZTS Go Client. For example, with our setup as described above, sherpa.api is our service identity and we have retrieved the X.509 certificate for this service. The file location are as follows: private-key: /var/lib/sia/keys/sherpa.api.key.pem certificate: /var/lib/sia/certs/sherpa.api.cert.pem First you need to update your Go project to indicate the dependency on the Athenz zts go client libraries: import ( \"github.com/AthenZ/athenz/clients/go/zts\" \"github.com/AthenZ/athenz/libs/go/athenzutils\" ) The ZTS server is running with a public X.509 certificate so we're not going to specify CA certificates for our request: ztsUrl := \"https://your.zts/zts/v1\" key := \"/var/lib/sia/keys/sherpa.api.key.pem\" cert := \"/var/lib/sia/certs/sherpa.api.cert.pem\" ztsClient, err := athenzutils.ZtsClient(ztsUrl, key, cert, \"\", false) if err != nil { log.Fatalf(\"Fatal: Error creating zts client: %v\", err) } domain := \"sherpa.property\" role := \"s3-uploader\" externalId := \"hockey\" awsCreds, err := ztsClient.GetAWSTemporaryCredentials(zts.DomainName(domain), zts.AWSArnRoleName(role), nil, externalId) if err != nil { log.Fatalf(\"Fatal: Error fetching AWS Credentials: %v\\n\", err) } fmt.Println(\"[default]\") fmt.Printf(\"aws_access_key_id=%s\\n\", awsCreds.AccessKeyId) fmt.Printf(\"aws_secret_access_key=%s\\n\", awsCreds.SecretAccessKey) fmt.Printf(\"aws_session_token=%s\\n\", awsCreds.SessionToken) Using AWS Temporary Credentials \u00b6 If you want to use the AWS temporary credentials with aws command line utilities, they can be set as environment variables or be added to the ~/.aws/credentials file for a given profile. The settings must include all three components returned by the api: access key id secret access key session token The following example shows the use of environment variables with temporary credentials: $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID={YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID} $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY={YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY} $ export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN={YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN} $ aws ec2 describe-instances --region us-west-1 The following example shows the use of the aws credentials file using default profile: $ cat ~/.aws/credentials [default] aws_access_key_id={YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID} aws_secret_access_key={YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY} aws_session_token={YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN} Checkout Using Temporary Security Credentials to Request Access to AWS Resources for full details how to use temporary credentials in AWS. ** Important ** When passing the role name that you're trying to assume in the aws-builder-creds utility as the value to the -r argument, it must be the AWS IAM Role name and not the role name in your Athenz domain. Troubleshooting \u00b6 ZTS Server returns a unique error message indicating what part of the configuration is causing the failure to fetch AWS temporary credentials. Athenz Domain Configuration \u00b6 Athenz Configuration Error: unable to retrieve AWS account for: <domainName> The domain, identified in the <domainName> field, does not have AWS account id configured. Follow the steps in the AWS Account ID Registration section to register your AWS account id for your domain. Athenz Role Configuration \u00b6 Athenz Configuration Error: Forbidden (assume_aws_role on <resource-name> for <principal>) This error indicates that the principal, identified in the <principal> field, requesting the temporary credentials is not authorized. There are two common issues that generate this error message: The caller is using the athenz role name as the value for the role name parameter (-r in the aws-builder-creds utility). The value for this parameter must be the AWS IAM role name and not the Athenz role name. Make sure the <principal> is included as a member in the role that you had setup in the Athenz AWS Assume Role Configuration Setup section in this document. AWS Configuration \u00b6 AWS Configuration Error: unable to assume role <roleName> in domain <domainName> for principal <principal> error: <aws-error-message> This error indicates that AWS STS refused to issue temporary credentials to the Athenz ZTS service. This usually indicates that either the role name specified in the request is incorrect (you must specify the IAM Role name you're trying to assume and not the Athenz Role Name) or the role in IAM does not have the trust relationship setup for ZTS service as described in the AWS Configuration Setup section in this document. If you have configured a non-default duration or an external id for your role make sure you're passing the correct values in the API.

Subsystems \u00b6 Before we go into the details of the authorization flow, it's important to understand the subsystems involved. The authorization (AuthZ) system shown in the figure below consists of several logical subsystems, which we will elaborate on in the following section. ZMS (AuthZ Management System) \u00b6 ZMS is where domains, roles, and policies are defined. This is Athenz's centralized authorization system and is likely part of a larger management system. In addition to allowing CRUD operations on the basic entities, ZMS provides an API to replicate the entities, per domain, to ZTS. It also can directly support the access check, both for internal management system checks, as well as a simple centralized deployment. ZMS is the source of truth for domains, roles, and policies for centralized authorization. ZMS supports a centralized call to check if a principal has access to a resource. Because ZMS supports service identities, ZMS can authenticate services. For centralized authorization, ZMS may be the only Athenz subsystem that you need to interact with. SIA (Service Identity Agent) \u00b6 SIA is required for authenticating existing unmanaged services. Any service that launches other services should integrate SIA (or an equivalent system). To confirm a service's identity, SIA communicates with ZTS. Centralized Access Control \u00b6 A traditional centralized mechanism works as expected for services that are not dealing with the decentralized authorization: the server with resources can simply ask the ZMS directly about access, passing its credentials (X.509 Cert) and resource/action information for a given principal to get a simple boolean answer. In this model, the Athenz Management Service is the only component that needs to be deployed and managed within your environment. This does not scale well enough for data-plane access, since a central service must be consulted, but requires no local installation of other components and related storage and synchronization logic, so it is suitable for human interaction and control-plane provisioning uses where the number of requests processed by the server is small and the latency for authorization checks is not important. Principals \u00b6 In Athenz, actors that can assume a role are called principals. Principals can be users or services, and users can be those looking for resources from a service or use the ZMS management console. The user or service must be configured with Athenz CA certificates and require mutual client authentication to accept and validate the service's X.509 certificate.

Once the request is authorized and validated, ZTS would contact Certificate Signer Daemon to mint a certificate for the instance. It would be valid for 30 days and the SIA running on the instance will be responsible to refresh the certificate daily. The service running on host can use the generated private key and the X.509 certificate it received from ZTS to identify itself to other services running within the organization. Copper Argos \u00b6 Copper Argos is Athenz generalized model for service providers to launch other service identities in an authorized way through a callback-based verification model. The high level requirements for Copper Argos are as follows: Once authorized as a service launcher in Athenz, the Provider will launch the Service by providing it with a signed identity document. SIA installed on the instance during bootstrap process or available as part of the base image that the service is deployed on will create a public/private key pair, generate a certificate request (CSR) and submit the identity document along with its CSR to Athenz ZTS Service. Athenz ZTS Service would carry out 2 authorization checks: a. It verifies that the Provider is authorized to launch services. This prohibits any service act like a provider and attempt to launch other services. b. It verifies that the Service being launched has authorized the Provider as its launcher. This prohibits any authorized Provider to launch any other service without explicit authorization from the tenant service administrator. Athenz ZTS contacts the Provider to validate the signed instance identity document. Once verified, ZTS contacts Certificate Signer Daemon to generate a X.509 Certificate valid for 30 days for the given CSR and returns to instance. SIA is responsible for contacting ZTS daily to refresh the service X.509 certificate. The next several section describe the for Copper Argos requirements in more detail. Provider Service Registration \u00b6 An important part of issuing X.509 certificates is trusting the Provider. The Provider must retrieve a TLS certificate for its own service from Athenz and use that as its Server Certificate. When ZTS contacts Provider Service to validate an instance document, it will require TLS authentication and verify that the certificate the service used for establish secure communication was issued for the expected provider service by ZTS itself. As part of its registration, the provider will also specify a unique registered dns suffix that would be combined with the service identity name and included as a dnsName attribute value in the X.509 certificate. For example, if an instance deployed is going to have an Athenz identity of sports.api and the Provider\u2019s dns suffix is sports.athenz.cloud, then the dnsName attribute in the generated X.509 certificate would be api.sports.sports.athenz.cloud. The official format for the dnsName attribute is <service>.<domain-with-dashes>.<dns-suffix> . Instance Register Request \u00b6 Before a tenant service can be launched by a specific provider and issued a TLS certificate for, the tenant domain administrator must authorize a specific provider service to launch its services. The provider is expected to configure separate launcher services for each data center and/or region it supports. This allows the tenant the flexibility to authorize the provider to launch its service in specific data center/region (e.g. grant launch action to provider sys.auth.aws.us-west-2) or in all supported data centers/regions (e.g. grant launch action to provider sys.auth.aws.*). ZTS does not have knowledge of each provider\u2019s signed instance document details - what\u2019s included, what is the format or what crypto algorithm was used to sign the document. Although each provider is strongly recommended to represent their instance documents as signed Json Web Tokens, ZTS treats it as an opaque string and relies on the registered provider service callback verifier to validate the document. ZTS does impose specific requirements on the X.509 CSR generated by SIA: The Subject CN in the CSR must be the Athenz service identity name (e.g. sports.api - api service in sports domain) The CSR must include a SAN dnsName attribute with the format: <service>.<domain-with-dashes>.<provider-dnsname-suffix> . The provider-dnsname-suffix must be provided by the provider service to the SIA agent. The provider must specify a unique identifier for the instance within the provider\u2019s namespace (this could be combination of multiple strings - e.g. instance-id.pod-id.cluster-id) and this information must be included in the CSR as another SAN dnsName attribute with the format: <provider-unique-instance-id>.instanceid.athenz.<provider-dnsname-suffix> . The ZTS server will use this information along with the issued TLS Certificate Serial number to revoke specific instances if they\u2019re compromised (more details are provided in the Instance Refresh Request section below). Instance Refresh Request \u00b6 During instance refresh request, ZTS Server carries out additional checks in addition to contacting provider service for verification of the instance. It will first verify that the connection is using the previous TLS certificate issued for the service and provider and the service authorization policies are still in place. In case a host is compromised and the attacker obtains the private key and ZTS issued X.509 certificate corresponding to that key, Athenz has additional checks in place to prevent the attacker to continuously refresh the certificate. A requirement of Copper Argos is that the CSR that the SIA generates must include a unique id that the provider has assigned to that instance in the X509 v3 SAN Extension dnsName field. Since each certificate is uniquely identified by its Serial Number (defined as BigInteger - e.g. Serial Number: 7e:14:6f:a2:33:b4:49:84:cb:f1:1f:c5:9d:a8:38:cb) generated by Athenz CA, Athenz ZTS can use that information along with instance id to maintain list of all issued certificates for instances with their serial numbers, detect compromised certificate refresh requests and revoke specific hosts from the refresh requests. When processing refresh requests, Athenz ZTS Server: Validates that the instance id in the CSR matches to the instance id of the certificate that was used for authentication. Retrieve the Instance ID record from the Certificate Database. This database is updated when the initial and refresh certificates are issued. The current serial number of the certificate must match to the certificate serial number registered in the instance ID record. The server keeps track of last 2 (current and previous) serial numbers thus allowing a single retry operation in case the client failed to update its local filesystem after receiving refreshed certificates. So if both the instance and the attacker start using the same instance id for refreshing certificates, Athenz ZTS will detect a mismatch between serial numbers assigned and used in those refresh requests, thus will revoke the instance from refreshing its certificates. Conclusion \u00b6 Copper Argos provides a secure and generic way for service providers to launch other authorized services with Athenz issued service identity X.509 certificates.","title":"Service Identity X.509 Certificates - Copper Argos"},{"location":"copper_argos/#copper-argos-athenz-service-identity-x509-certificates","text":"Introduction Copper Argos Provider Service Registration Instance Register Request Instance Refresh Request Conclusion","title":"Copper Argos: Athenz Service Identity X.509 Certificates"},{"location":"copper_argos/#introduction","text":"Rather than having a service administrator generate a key pair and register in Athenz, a new solution called Copper Argos was designed and implemented that would allow the service to be identified by its X.509 certificate issued by Athenz: Athenz would integrate with a Certificate Signer Daemon that would store its private key in HSM (e.g. AWS CloudHSM) A Service Identity Agent (SIA) running on an instance would generate a key pair on the instance itself, generate a CSR and send along with its authentication details to ZTS Server to request a certificate for the service.

ZTS does impose specific requirements on the X.509 CSR generated by SIA: The Subject CN in the CSR must be the Athenz service identity name (e.g. sports.api - api service in sports domain) The CSR must include a SAN dnsName attribute with the format: <service>.<domain-with-dashes>.<provider-dnsname-suffix> . The provider-dnsname-suffix must be provided by the provider service to the SIA agent. The provider must specify a unique identifier for the instance within the provider\u2019s namespace (this could be combination of multiple strings - e.g. instance-id.pod-id.cluster-id) and this information must be included in the CSR as another SAN dnsName attribute with the format: <provider-unique-instance-id>.instanceid.athenz.<provider-dnsname-suffix> . The ZTS server will use this information along with the issued TLS Certificate Serial number to revoke specific instances if they\u2019re compromised (more details are provided in the Instance Refresh Request section below).","title":"Instance Register Request"},{"location":"copper_argos/#instance-refresh-request","text":"During instance refresh request, ZTS Server carries out additional checks in addition to contacting provider service for verification of the instance. It will first verify that the connection is using the previous TLS certificate issued for the service and provider and the service authorization policies are still in place. In case a host is compromised and the attacker obtains the private key and ZTS issued X.509 certificate corresponding to that key, Athenz has additional checks in place to prevent the attacker to continuously refresh the certificate. A requirement of Copper Argos is that the CSR that the SIA generates must include a unique id that the provider has assigned to that instance in the X509 v3 SAN Extension dnsName field. Since each certificate is uniquely identified by its Serial Number (defined as BigInteger - e.g. Serial Number: 7e:14:6f:a2:33:b4:49:84:cb:f1:1f:c5:9d:a8:38:cb) generated by Athenz CA, Athenz ZTS can use that information along with instance id to maintain list of all issued certificates for instances with their serial numbers, detect compromised certificate refresh requests and revoke specific hosts from the refresh requests. When processing refresh requests, Athenz ZTS Server: Validates that the instance id in the CSR matches to the instance id of the certificate that was used for authentication. Retrieve the Instance ID record from the Certificate Database. This database is updated when the initial and refresh certificates are issued. The current serial number of the certificate must match to the certificate serial number registered in the instance ID record. The server keeps track of last 2 (current and previous) serial numbers thus allowing a single retry operation in case the client failed to update its local filesystem after receiving refreshed certificates. So if both the instance and the attacker start using the same instance id for refreshing certificates, Athenz ZTS will detect a mismatch between serial numbers assigned and used in those refresh requests, thus will revoke the instance from refreshing its certificates.","title":"Instance Refresh Request"},{"location":"copper_argos/#conclusion","text":"Copper Argos provides a secure and generic way for service providers to launch other authorized services with Athenz issued service identity X.509 certificates.","title":"Conclusion"},{"location":"copper_argos_dev/","text":"Copper Argos: Athenz Service Identity X.509 Certificates Development \u00b6 What is Copper Argos Provider Service Registration Tenant Service Launch Authorization Instance Register Request Instance Refresh Request Instance Revocation Request Athenz RDL Instance Register Request Instance Identity Response Instance Refresh Request Instance Revoke Request Instance Provider RDL Authorization Policies System Providers Provider Authorized DNS Suffix Service Authorized Providers Sample Implementation and Setup Tasks Athenz System Setup Provider Service Implementation and Registration Athenz Authorized Provider Registration Tenant Service Registration Provider Client Implementation What is Copper Argos \u00b6 Copper Argos extends Athenz with generalized model for service providers to launch other identities in an authorized way through a callback-based verification model. With this model each provider is responsible for their instance document verification service instead of embedding that logic inside ZTS. Provider Service Registration \u00b6 Each provider is a registered service identity object in Athenz. As such, the provider domain administrator will create the service identity object in their domain and provide the following attributes using zms-cil utility or the REST API. (Athenz UI does not expose optional service attributes since they\u2019re not commonly used). * Provider Endpoint - A REST API endpoint that implements Provider RDL and ZTS will contact to validate the instance document (ServiceIdentity already has the providerEndpoint attribute) Domain administrator will then need to follow up with the Athenz Team to authorize Provider Service as an Instance Launcher Service in Athenz. The Provider will also specify the DNS suffix that will be used by its tenants. There will be a policy in sys.auth domain that grants launch action to instance resource to the providers role. Once approved, the Athenz System admin will add the provider service identity to the providers role in the sys.auth domain either using zms-cli or Athenz UI. There will be policy granting access to the specified Provider SAN dnsName attribute suffix to the list service provider. Requirements for Provider Service: * It must retrieve a TLS certificate for its service from Athenz and use that as its Service Certificate. * When ZTS Contacts Provider Service to validate an instance document, it will require TLS authentication and verify that the certificate the service used for authentication was issued for the expected provider service by ZTS itself. * ZTS issues TLS certificates valid for 30 days only, so the Provider Service Admin must have the capability to periodically refresh its certificate by requesting a new one from ZTS Server (e.g. daily) and dynamically update its service to use the refreshed certificates. Tenant Service Launch Authorization \u00b6 Before a tenant service can be launched by a specific provider and issued a TLS certificate for, the tenant domain administrator must authorize a specific provider service to launch its services. This will require that a role and policy to be created in the tenant\u2019s domain. For example, if weather.api service wants to authorize athenz.aws provider to launch its services, it will need to create the following policy and role in their domain: * Policy: grant launch to aws-provider on weather:service.api * Role: aws-provider role member: athenz.aws.us-west-2 The change can be carried out with using zms-cli or Athenz UI. Instance Register Request \u00b6 Once the service admin creates the appropriate role and policy in its domain authorizing the provider service to bootstrap its instance, it can submit the launch request to the provider service. The steps of the bootstrap process pertaining Athenz integration would include: As part of the launch request, the admin will specify the Athenz domain and service that should be assigned to the instance. The provider service will generate an instance identity document, sign it with its private key and securely transfer this document along with its signature onto to the bootstrapped host. As part of the bootstrap process or possible as part of the image, the Service Identity Agent (SIA) will also be installed on the host. SIA will generate a public/private key pair on the host, generate a CSR using the newly generated private key. The CSR requirements are as follows: The Subject CN in the CSR must be the Athenz service identity name (e.g. weather.api - api service in weather domain) The CSR must include a SAN dnsName attribute with the format: <service-with-domain>.<provider-dnsname-suffix> . The provider-dnsname-suffix must match the value registered for the provider service. The <service-with-domain> part is left up to to the provider to define what format they want to use (e.g. <service>.<domain> or <service>.<domain-with-dashes> ). ZTS server will pass these hostnames to the provider as entries in the attribute field for validation. The provider must specify a unique identifier for the instance within the provider\u2019s namespace (this could be combination of multiple strings - e.g. instance-id.pod-id.cluster-id) and this information must be included in the CSR as another SAN dnsName attribute with the format: <provider-unique-instance-id>.instanceid.athenz.<provider-dnsname-suffix> . The ZTS server will use this information along with the issued TLS Certificate Serial number to revoke specific instances if they\u2019re compromised. SIA will generate an InstanceRegisterInformation object that will include attestation data (this would include the instance identity document, its signature and other attributes that will be necessary for the provider to validate and confirm the instance register request from ZTS) received from the provider and submit the post request to ZTS Server. ZTS Server will carry out the following authorization and verification checks before contacting provider service: The provider service in the info object has been authorized in Athenz to launch services (policy exists in sys.auth domain). Service specified in the info object (domain.service) has authorized provider service in the info object to launch itself (policy exists in the service\u2019s own domain). The provider service is registered in Athenz, has a providerEndpoint (verified as internal ip address) and providerDnsNameSuffix attributes defined. The cn in the CSR matches to the specific domain and service names. The CSR must include only 2 dnsName attributes with the expected format: <service-with-domain>.<provider-dnsname-suffix> <provider-unique-instance-id>.instanceid.athenz.<provider-dnsname-suffix> ZTS Server will contact Provider service at its configured endpoint and verify that the TLS certificate used for authentication by the provider service matches to the service name and was issued by ZTS server itself. ZTS Server will generate an InstanceConfirmation object and submit the post request to the Provider Service. In the InstanceConfirmation object, ZTS server will include the following entries in the optional attributes map: sanDNS: comma separated list of dnsNames attributes in the CSR - there will only be 2 as defined in 6(e) above sanIP - comma separated list of IP addresses in the CSR if any were specified clientIP - the IP address of the client cloudAccount - domain\u2019s account id if one is configured The Provider Service will be responsible for: Validating Signature Validating the instance id Validating the bootup time is within acceptable time period (e..g 5 mins) Validating hostnames included in the CSR Validating IP addresses (if available) included in the CSR Once ZTS service receives a successful response from the Provider Service, it will submit the CSR to Certsignd to generate a X.509 Certificate ZTS Server will retrieve the Serial number from the Certificate and register the certificate along with instanceid and provider service name in its certificate database. This will be used to monitor refresh certificate operations and, in case of a compromise, revoke specific instances from the capability to refresh their own certificates. Instance Refresh Request \u00b6 During instance refresh request, ZTS Server again contacts provider service for verification of the instance. This is necessary in case the credentials have been compromised and the original instance is no longer running and will allow the provider to verify that the instance is indeed still running. ZTS will also verify that the connection is using the previous TLS certificate issued for the service and provider and the authorization policies are still in place. The steps would include: SIA will generate a public/private key pair on the host, generate a CSR using the newly generated private key. The CSR requirements are as follows: The Subject CN in the CSR must be the Athenz service identity name (e.g. weather.api - api service in weather domain) The CSR must include a SAN dnsName attribute with the format: <service-with-domain>.<provider-dnsname-suffix> that was used in the original register request. The provider must specify a unique identifier for the instance within the provider namespace (this could be combination of multiple strings - e.g. instance-id.pod-id.cluster-id) and this information must be included in the CSR as another SAN dnsName attribute with the format: <provider-unique-instance-id>.instanceid.athenz.<provider-dnsname-suffix> . The ZTS server will use this information along with the issued TLS Certificate Serial number to revoke specific instances if they\u2019re compromised. SIA will generate an InstanceRefreshInformation object including attestation data and submit the post request to ZTS Server. It will be required to use the TLS certificate that was issued to that instance previously by ZTS Server. ZTS Server will carry out the following authorization and verification checks before contacting provider service: The provider service in the info object has been authorized in Athenz to launch services (policy exists in sys.auth domain). Service specified in the info object (domain.service) has authorized provider service in the info object to launch itself (policy exists in the service\u2019s own domain). The cn in the CSR matches to the specific domain and service names. The TLS certificate SIA used to contact ZTS server must be for the same service. The TLS certificate SIA used to contact ZTS server must have the same provider and the 2 dnsName attributes as the CSR. ZTS Server will extract the instanceid from CSR and verify that the instance has not been revoked and the serial number matches to the registered entry in the certificate database. ZTS Server will contact Provider service at its configured endpoint and verify that the TLS certificate used for authentication by the provider service matches to the service name and was issued by ZTS server itself. ZTS Server will generate an InstanceConfirmation object and submit the post request to the Provider Service. In the InstanceConfirmation object, ZTS server will include the attestation data presented by instance. The Provider Service will be responsible for: Validating attestation data Validating hostnames included in the CSR Validating IP addresses (if available) included in the CSR Once ZTS service receives a successful response from the Provider Service, it will submit the CSR to Certsignd to generate a X.509 Certificate ZTS Server will retrieve the Serial number from the new Certificate and update the certificate database with the new serial number. Instance Revocation Request \u00b6 If necessary, the domain administrators must be able to revoke specific instances from having the capability to refresh their certificate. The steps would be: Domain Admin will issue a HTTP DELETE /instance/\u2026 request to ZTS Server. ZTS Server will authorize the request and update the serial number for the requested instance id in the certificate database to -1. This operation will revoke the instance from refreshing its certificates. Athenz RDL \u00b6 Instance Register Request \u00b6 InstanceRegisterInformation is the information a provider-hosted booting instance must provide to Athenz to authenticate: type InstanceRegisterInformation Struct { ServiceName provider; //the provider service name (i.e. \"aws.us-west-2\") DomainName domain; //the domain of the instance SimpleName service; //the service this instance is supposed to run String attestationData;//signed identity document containing attributes //like IP address, instance-id, account#, signature, etc String csr; //the Certificate Signing Request for the expected //X.509 certificate in the response String ssh (optional); //if present, return an SSH host certificate. //Format is JSON.

The request must be done using the previously issued client TLS certificate. type InstanceRefreshInformation Struct { String attestationData (optional); //identity attestation data including //document with its signature containing attributes like IP //address, instance-id, account#, etc. String csr (optional); //the Certificate Signing Request for the expected //X.509 certificate in the response String ssh (optional); //if present, return an SSH host certificate. //Format is JSON. Bool token (optional); // if true, return a service token signed by //ZTS for this service } resource InstanceIdentity POST \"/instance/{provider}/{domain}/{service}/{instanceId}\" { ServiceName provider; //the provider service name (i.e. \"aws.us-west-2\") DomainName domain; //the domain of the instance SimpleName service; //the service this instance is supposed to run PathElement instanceId; //the instance id that\u2019s unique within this provider InstanceRefreshInformation info; //the refresh request authenticate; //only TLS Certificate authentication is allowed expected OK; exceptions { ResourceError BAD_REQUEST; ResourceError FORBIDDEN; ResourceError NOT_FOUND; ResourceError UNAUTHORIZED; ResourceError INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR; } } Instance Revoke Request \u00b6 resource InstanceIdentity DELETE \"/instance/{provider}/{domain}/{service}/{instanceId}\" { ServiceName provider; //the provider service name (i.e. \"aws.us-west-2\") DomainName domain; //the domain of the instance SimpleName service; //the service this instance is supposed to run PathElement instanceId; //the instance id that\u2019s unique within this provider authorize(\u201cdelete\u201d, {domain}:instance.{instanceId}; expected NO_CONTENT; exceptions { ResourceError BAD_REQUEST; ResourceError FORBIDDEN; ResourceError NOT_FOUND; ResourceError UNAUTHORIZED; ResourceError INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR; } } Instance Provider RDL \u00b6 This is the RDL that any provider that is authorized to create instances through Athenz must implement. This interface must be available over HTTPS only. type InstanceConfirmation Struct { ServiceName provider; //the provider service name DomainName domain; //the domain of the instance SimpleName service; //the service this instance is supposed to run String attestationData; //signed identity document containing attributes //like IP address, instance-id, account#, signature, etc. Map<String,String> attributes (optional); //additional non-signed attributes that assist //in attestation. I.e. \"instanceId\u201d, keyId\", \"accessKey\", etc } Confirm instance identity information and return appropriate response to ZTS Server. On return from the confirmation, the resulting InstanceConfirmation may have additional useful attributes added, for example attributes taken from the identity document like \"account\" number or a canonical value like \"network\" that gets identified differently with different providers. resource InstanceConfirmation POST \"/instance\" { InstanceConfirmation confirmation; authenticate; expected OK; exceptions { ResourceError BAD_REQUEST; ResourceError FORBIDDEN; ResourceError UNAUTHORIZED; } } resource InstanceConfirmation POST \"/refresh\" (name=PostRefreshConfirmation) { InstanceConfirmation confirmation; Authenticate; expected OK; exceptions { ResourceError BAD_REQUEST; ResourceError FORBIDDEN; ResourceError UNAUTHORIZED; } } Authorization Policies \u00b6 System Providers \u00b6 Athenz will maintain list of authorized provider services in sys.auth domain. If necessary, we can configure specific policies to grant additional users access over the roles/policies used to configure the list of provider. Domain: sys.auth Role: providers Members: <provider-name(s)> (e.g. openstack.cluster1) Policy: providers Assertion: grant launch to providers on sys.auth:instance Provider Authorized DNS Suffix \u00b6 When generating a CSR to request a TLS certificate for a service, the sia agent must know what DNS Suffix is the provider authorized to use so it can include the dnsName attribute in the CSR in the expected form (e.g. <service>.<domain-with-dashes>.<provider-dns-suffix> ). ZTS must validate that the provider is authorized to launch a service with that DNS suffix. For now, this information will be authorized against a policy in special sys.auth domain. Domain: sys.auth Role: provider.<provider-name> (e.g. provider.openstack.cluster1) Members: <provider-name(s)> (e.g. openstack.cluster1) Policy: provider.<provider-name> Assertion: grant launch to provider.<provider-name> on sys.auth:dns.<provider-suffix> Service Authorized Providers \u00b6 Each service will have a role/policy in their own domain that they control whether or not authorize specific providers to launch their services. For example, service weather.api wants to authorize AWS services to launch its services: Domain: weather.api Role: api_providers Members: athenz.aws Policy: api_providers Assertion: grant launch to \u201capi_providers\u201d on \u201cweather:service.api\u201d Sample Implementation and Setup Tasks \u00b6 Athenz System Setup \u00b6 Create the provider\u2019s role: $ zms-cli -d sys.auth add-regular-role providers Create the provider\u2019s policy: $ zms-cli -d sys.auth add-policy providers grant launch to providers on instance Provider Service Implementation and Registration \u00b6 Implement provider service that implements Instance Provider RDL. Register the provider service in Athenz in the provider\u2019s domain. For example, we\u2019ll be registering a provider service called openstack.cluster1. Generate private/public key pair for the service. $ openssl genrsa -out service_private.key 2048 $ openssl rsa -in service_private.key -pubout > service_public.key Create the service identity in Athenz with public key id: v0 $ zms-cli -d openstack add-service cluster1 v0 ./service_public.key Determine the https endpoint for your service that ZTS will contact to verify instance information. For example, https://provider-cluster1.openstack.athenz.com:4443/hostsigner/v1 and set the endpoint for the service: $ zms-cli -d openstack set-service-endpoint cluster1 https://provider-cluster1.openstack.athenz.com:4443/hostsigner/v1 Obtain a TLS certificate from ZTS Server for the service to run with. If your service is Jetty based, then the private key and certificate must be added to a keystore using the openssl utility. The certificate is valid for 30 days, so you must setup a cron job that periodically retrieves an updated certificates and your service is refreshed to use to the new certificate. $ zts-svccert -domain openstack -service cluster1 -private-key ./service_private.key -key-version v0 -zts https://<zts-hostname>:4443/zts/v1 -dns-domain athenz.com Determine the dns suffix for your provider service and submit a request to the Athenz system administrators to register the provider service with its dns suffix as an authorized provider service in Athenz Athenz Authorized Provider Registration \u00b6 Verify the dns suffix requested for the provider and, if valid, register the service in Athenz Add the service to the providers role: $ zms-cli -d sys.auth add-member providers openstack.cluster1 Register the dns suffix for the provider service. For example, cluster1.ostk.athenz.cloud $ zms-cli -d sys.auth add-regular-role provider.openstack.providers openstack.cluster1 $ zms-cli -d sys.auth add-policy provider.openstack.providers grant launch to provider.openstack.providers on dns.cluster1.ostk.athenz.cloud Tenant Service Registration \u00b6 Authorize provider service to launch its instances. For example, weater domain wants to authorize its service api to be launched by openstack.cluster1 provider. $ zms-cli -d weather add-regular-role openstack_providers openstack.cluster1 $ zms-cli -d weather add-policy openstack_providers grant launch to openstack_providers on weather:service.api Provider Client Implementation \u00b6 Provider must implement a client that will communicate with ZTS and execute Instance Register and Instance Refresh requests. When bootstrapping the the tenant instance, the Provider service must pass to the client the following details: the provider service name (e.g. openstack.cluster1) its dns suffix (e.g. cluster1.ostk.athenz.cloud) signed instance identity document The client will generate a CSR based on the details it received from its provider service, include the CSR in the InstanceRegisterInformation object and post it to ZTS. The client will be responsible for storing the certificate used from ZTS on the local host and use it for its subsequent requests to ZTS to refresh the certificate.","title":"Service Identity X.509 Certificate Support Requirements - Copper Argos"},{"location":"copper_argos_dev/#copper-argos-athenz-service-identity-x509-certificates-development","text":"What is Copper Argos Provider Service Registration Tenant Service Launch Authorization Instance Register Request Instance Refresh Request Instance Revocation Request Athenz RDL Instance Register Request Instance Identity Response Instance Refresh Request Instance Revoke Request Instance Provider RDL Authorization Policies System Providers Provider Authorized DNS Suffix Service Authorized Providers Sample Implementation and Setup Tasks Athenz System Setup Provider Service Implementation and Registration Athenz Authorized Provider Registration Tenant Service Registration Provider Client Implementation","title":"Copper Argos: Athenz Service Identity X.509 Certificates Development"},{"location":"copper_argos_dev/#what-is-copper-argos","text":"Copper Argos extends Athenz with generalized model for service providers to launch other identities in an authorized way through a callback-based verification model.

Concepts \u00b6 Role based Access Control (RBAC) system Symbolic names are used to identify the entities involved in authorization, so humans can read and understand the assertions Namespaces are strictly partitioned into Domains, which imply an ownership and control aspect to the names Enforcement can be factored such that it can be done in a distributed way, making possible data-plane checks that do not go off-box Administrative tasks can be delegated to created subdomains to avoid reliance on central \"super user\" administrative roles. Multi-tenancy relationships across domains can also take advantage of delegated administration Cryptographic signatures are used to ensure the fidelity of assertions and their lifecycle attributes Policy orientation, as opposed to Resource orientation, allows few assertions (in policies) to affect a potentially large number of resources, and allows more flexible scoping via wildcarding over groups of resources. In Athenz, the authorization management server converts all incoming data to lowercase before any processing - this applies to all data types within Athenz (e.g. domain names, role names, policy names, resource group values, etc). Data Model \u00b6 Terminology \u00b6 Domain - a partition/namespace/account of control and isolation Role - an entity that takes action on resources, when assumed by a principal Resource - an entity to take action on, referred to by unique name Policy - a set of assertions that govern usage of resources Assertion - a quadruple of <effect, role, action, resource> Principal - an authenticated user or service that assumes one or more roles User - a user identity that is authenticated by a particular authority Service - An identity that exposes reusable resources, authenticated by an Athenz-aware container, reachable via an explicit endpoint. Provider - a type of service that participates in the multi-tenant provisioning protocol. Tenant - a Domain that is provisioned to access some Resources in a Provider Group - A group is a collection of user and service principals Control Plane - operations done to provision or otherwise setup a system, outside its normal operation. Data Plane - operations done in the normal usage of a system, after it is set up. These operations are usually highly performance sensitive. There are numerous domains, and domains can themselves \u201ccontain\u201d subdomains, from a creation/deletion perspective. However, all domains and subdomains, regardless of their administrative relationships, are independent and share no state. Relationships between them (i.e. quotas, billing roll ups, etc) must be explicitly introduced if desired. Roles, Policies and their Assertions, and Services are all defined in a Domain. Domains \u00b6 Domains are namespaces, strictly partitioned, providing a context for authoritative statements to be made about entities it contains. Only system administrators can create and destroy top-level domains. Each domain is assigned users in an administrative role. Those admins can, in turn, create and delete subdomains, that is, domains that start with the parent domain as a prefix, using a '.' as a domain delimiter. For example, \"media\" is a top-level domain, and \"media.news\" is a subdomain of it. It is important to note that the only relation between these two domains involves creation and destruction of the domains -- the two domains share no state by default, and there is no inheritance or other relation between them other than that implied by their names. This allows all domains (whether top-level or subdomains) to be completely partitioned from each other, and the ownership of the entities defined within a domain is clear. A domain is a place to group your resources and entities. All resources are partitioned across some set of domains Domains are given a symbolic name, so humans can easily understand a reference to them The domain name is used as a namespace for resource names Domains are similar the concept of an account, and provides a \u201cwalled garden\u201d in which to operate Resources \u00b6 Resources aren't explicitly modeled in Athenz, they are referred to by name. A resource is something that is \"owned\" and controlled in a specific domain. Concrete example: a machine Abstract example: a security policy Identified by a canonical name, so humans can comprehend references to it When referring to resources for authorization, a global naming system needs to be introduced to handle names in namespaces. A Resource Name is defined as follows: { Domain }:{ Entity } The Domain is the namespace mentioned above, and the Entity is an entity path (delimited by periods) within that namespace. The two are often used together to form a short resource name. For example, if the media.news property provisions a table in a db service, the resource name for the table may look like this: media.news:storage.db.table Policies \u00b6 To implement access control, we have policies in our domain that govern the use of our resources. A policy is a set of assertions (rules) about granting or denying an operation/action on a resource. For example, the assertion [grant, update, dev, storage.db.table] would grant the update operation/action to all the members in the dev role on the storage.db.table resource. Note that the assertion fields are declared as general strings, as they may contain \"globbing\" style wildcards, for example \"media.news:role.*\", which would apply to any entity that matched the pattern. Roles \u00b6 A role can be thought of as a group, anyone in the group can assume the role that takes a particular action. Every policy assertion describes what can be done by a role. A role can also delegate the determination of membership to another trusted domain. For example, a netops role managed outside a property domain. This is how we can model tenant relations between a provider domain and tenant domains. Because roles are defined in domains, they can be partitioned by domain, unlike users, which are global. This allows the distributed operation to be more easily scaled. Principals \u00b6 The actors in Athenz that can assume a role are called principals. These principals are authenticated and can be users (for example, authenticated by their Unix or Kerberos credentials). Principals can also be services that are authenticated by a service management system. Athenz currently provides service identity and authentication support. In either case, the identity is expressed as a resource name, and the proof of that identity is provided as an X509 certificate. Users \u00b6 Users are actually defined in some external authority, e.g. Unix or Kerberos system. A special domain is reserved for the purpose of namespacing users, the name of that domain is user , so some example users are: user.john user.doe The credentials that the external system requires are exchanged for X509 certificates before operating on any data. Services \u00b6 The concept of a Service Identity is introduced as the identity of independent agents of execution. Services are defined as a subdomain of the managing domain, which provides a simple way of naming them. For example: media.news.msbe sports.storage The relationship of a service identity and its parent domain essentially means that the parent domain is an authority for the service itself, from a management perspective. A Service Identity may be used as a principal when specifying Roles, just like a User. Athenz provides support for registering such a Service Identity, in a domain, along with its public key that can be used to later verify an NToken that is presented by the service. Groups \u00b6 To simplify principal management, the users and services can be included in Groups. Then, the Group can be added as a principal to any role within Athenz thus granting the members of that group access to the configured resources. For example, if you need to add your development team members to multiple roles in your domain, you can create a group called dev-team , add those users into that group and then include the group as a member in the corresponding roles. When you need to remove or add a member, then you only need to modify the membership of your dev-team group. The groups cannot contain other groups. Tokens \u00b6 Athenz authorization system utilizes 2 types of tokens: Principal Tokens (NTokens) and Access Tokens. Principal Token (NToken) \u00b6 The Principal token can be thought of an identity token because it identifies either a user or a service. Users submit their credentials to ZMS, which validates those credentials and generates, signs and returns principal tokens. A service generates its principal token using the service's private key. The principal token can then be used to access role tokens. A principal token is serialized as a string with following attributes: version (v) - the version of the token - U1 for user tokens and S1 for service tokens domain (d) - the domain of principal. For users this will always be \"user\" name (n) - the name of the principal host (h) - the FQDN of the host that issued this token salt (a) - a salt time (t) - the time the token was issued expires (e) - the time the token expires keyId (k) - the key identifier of the private key that was used to sign this token ip (i) - the IP address where the request to get this token was initiated from authorized-services (b) - the list of services authorized to use this user token signature (s) - the signature of the other items The single letter in parentheses is the key in the serialized string, where semicolons separate key value pairs, and the key and value are separated by an equals sign. For example: v=U1;d=user;n=joe;h=host.athenz.org;a=bb4e;t=1442255237;e=1442258837;k=0;i=10.72.42.32;s=Jw8SvYGYrk Note that requests that include a principal token should be protected to keep the token from being intercepted and reused (for the lifetime of the token). It is strongly recommended to always use HTTPS for such requests. Access Tokens \u00b6 Athenz supports the OAuth2 standard by enabling the generation of Access Tokens. Access tokens represent an authoritative statement that a given principal may assume some number of roles in a domain for a limited period. They are signed to prevent tampering. Using Access Tokens instead of directly asking for an access check with a principal identity, reduces the chance of providing identity details to a compromised service. This mechanism also allows a service to make a completely local access check against the cached policies used by the policy engine.","title":"Data Model"},{"location":"data_model/#architecture-data-model","text":"Concepts Data Model Terminology Domains Resources Policies Roles Principals Users Services Groups Tokens Principal Token - NToken Access Tokens Having a firm grasp on some fundamental concepts will help you understand the Athenz architecture, the flow for both centralized and decentralized authorization, and how to set up role-based authorization.","title":"Architecture - Data Model"},{"location":"data_model/#concepts","text":"Role based Access Control (RBAC) system Symbolic names are used to identify the entities involved in authorization, so humans can read and understand the assertions Namespaces are strictly partitioned into Domains, which imply an ownership and control aspect to the names Enforcement can be factored such that it can be done in a distributed way, making possible data-plane checks that do not go off-box Administrative tasks can be delegated to created subdomains to avoid reliance on central \"super user\" administrative roles.

This mechanism also allows a service to make a completely local access check against the cached policies used by the policy engine.","title":"Access Tokens"},{"location":"decent_authz_flow/","text":"In this section, we're going to examine the decentralized authorization flow. Subsystems \u00b6 Before we go into the details of the authorization flow, it's important to understand the subsystems. ZMS (AuthZ Management System) \u00b6 ZMS is where domains, roles, and policies are defined. This is Athenz's centralized authorization system and is likely part of a larger management system. In addition to allowing CRUD operations on the basic entities, ZMS provides an API to replicate the entities, per domain, to ZTS. It also can directly support the access check, both for internal management system checks, as well as a simple centralized deployment. ZMS is the source of truth for domains, roles, and policies for centralized authorization. ZMS supports a centralized call to check if a principal has access to a resource. Because ZMS supports service identities, ZMS can authenticate services. SIA (Service Identity Agent) \u00b6 SIA is required for authenticating existing services. Any service should integrate SIA (or an equivalent system). To confirm a service's identity, SIA communicates with ZTS. ZTS (AuthZ Token System) \u00b6 ZTS, the authentication token service, is only needed to support decentralized or data plane functionality. In many ways, ZTS is like a local replica of ZMS's data to check a principal's authentication and confirm membership in roles within a domain. The authentication is in the form of a signed Access Token that can be presented to any decentralized service that wants to authorize access efficiently. If needed, multiple ZTS instances will be distributed to different data centers as needed to scale for issuing tokens. ZPE (AuthZ Policy Engine) \u00b6 Like ZTS, ZPE, the authorization policy engine is only needed to support the decentralized authorization. ZPE is the subsystem of Athenz that evaluates policies for a set of roles to yield an allowed or a denied response. ZPE is a library that your service calls and only refers to a local policy cache for your services domain (a small amount of data). ZPU (AuthZ PolicyEngine Updater) \u00b6 Like ZTS and ZPE, ZPU is only needed to support the decentralized authorization. The policy updater is the utility that retrieves from ZTS the policy files for provisioned domains on a host, which ZPE uses to evaluate access requests. Decentralized Access Control \u00b6 A more interesting scenario introduces the local policy engine (ZPE), and a few supporting changes. Rather than directly asking for an access check with a principal identity, the identity is instead used to get an Access Token, and that is presented to the target service until it expires. This mechanism allows a service to make a completely local access check against ZPE, given an Access Token and locally cached policies. Specifically, as shown in the diagram below, the client service/user uses its identity x.509 certificate along with its private key that it got from local SIA (1) to get an authorization token (Access Token) from ZTS (2), and then presents the access token to a target service to access its resources (3). That service can make use of a local ZPE to validate the role assertions in the access token, and then correlate them to the asynchronously updated Policies for the domain involved. The ZPE can make the decision locally, without going off box. It has no knowledge about specific users, only roles, and because roles and policies are always in the domain, the amount of data to distribute to the machine is small. The model works exactly the same when using X.509 certificates instead of tokens. The service would use its identity X.509 certificate to request a X.509 Role Certificate from ZTS and then would make the call to the target service using the X.509 Role Certificate. The target service would first validate the X.509 Certificate and call ZPE to extract the role certificate to carry out the authorization check.","title":"Decentralized Authorization Flow"},{"location":"decent_authz_flow/#subsystems","text":"Before we go into the details of the authorization flow, it's important to understand the subsystems.","title":"Subsystems"},{"location":"decent_authz_flow/#zms-authz-management-system","text":"ZMS is where domains, roles, and policies are defined.

The required steps to setup the environment for provider and tenant services to support centralized access control are as follows: System administrator creates the provider and tenant domains. Tenant Domain administrator generates a public/private key pair and registers a service in its domain. Provider Domain administrator creates a role and policy that grants access to the given role with configured action and resource. Provider Domain administrator adds the Tenant Service to the role to grant access. Tenant Domain administrator installs the private key on the host that will be running the client/tenant service. Required Components \u00b6 To support centralized access control in your applications, you only need to install and configure the Athenz ZMS server along with the Athenz UI. Please follow these guides to make sure you have both of those components up and running in your environment: ZMS Server UI Server To build the client and server components of this example, you need to download and install Go and Git client if you don't already have these available on your box: The Go Programming Language Git client Make sure your GOPATH variable is set and the PATH variable includes the $(GOPATH)/bin to run the utilities. Service Definition \u00b6 Let's first define our service that needs to be Athenz protected. We have a simple recommendation service that returns either a movie or tv show for the caller. It has two endpoints: GET /rec/v1/movie GET /rec/v1/tvshow So in this first release we just want to protect access to these endpoints. The traffic is very low - we only expect a couple of requests an hour so we have decided to use Athenz' centralized authorization model. Resource Definition \u00b6 Defining resources and actions the principals are authorized to execute is one of the most important tasks in the authorization process. Based on our endpoints, it's expected that we'll have 2 general resources: movie tvshow The resources are referenced in their own domain namespace. So those are valid if your domain is specifically created to support this recommendation service only. But's lets assume we might add rental support later, so we need to make sure the policies are based on service specific resources. So we'll define our resources as: rec.movie rec.tvshow Support action for these resources would be read . We can extend our authorization policies later on if we need to introduce other actions - such as write or list as we add more functionality into our service. Athenz Management Setup \u00b6 Once we have defined what our resources and actions are, we can create their respective client and server (also commonly referred as tenant and provider) roles and policies in Athenz. Go to Athenz UI and login with your account which should have system administrator access. Follow the instructions in the following guide to setup the required access control: Access Control Setup Code Changes \u00b6 Both the client and server implementors need to make changes in their respective code bases to support centralized authorization checks. The client needs to make sure to submit its service identity as part of its request, while the service needs to carry out the authorization check based on that service identity to determine if it request should be processed or not. Client Changes \u00b6 While we'll use the curl client to make the http calls to our example service, we provide a sample client code that utilizes our zmssvctoken go library to generate service identity tokens. The full client source code is available from: https://github.com/AthenZ/athenz/blob/master/utils/zms-svctoken/zms-svctoken.go Client Import Dependency Update \u00b6 First you need to update your go client to import the zms service token library. import ( \"github.com/AthenZ/athenz/libs/go/zmssvctoken\" ) Obtaining NTokens \u00b6 The domain administrator must have already generated a public/private key pair for the service and registered public key in Athenz. The private key must be available on the host where the client will be running. // load private key bytes , err := ioutil . ReadFile ( privateKeyFile ) if err != nil { log . Fatalln ( err ) } // get token builder instance builder , err := zmssvctoken . NewTokenBuilder ( domain , service , bytes , keyVersion ) if err != nil { log . Fatalln ( err ) } // set optional attributes builder . SetExpiration ( 60 * time . Minute ) tok := builder . Token () // get a token for use ntoken , err := tok . Value () Once we have our ntoken value, the http client before contacting the provider service needs to add it as the value for the Athenz-Principal-Auth header: req , err := http . NewRequest ( \"GET\" , \"http://recommend-host/rec/v1/movie\" , nil ) // ... req . Header . Add ( \"Athenz-Principal-Auth\" , ntoken ) Build Go zms_svctoken Client Utility \u00b6 To download, compile and install zms_svctoken utility, execute the following command: $ go get github.com/AthenZ/athenz/utils/zms-svctoken/... Server Changes \u00b6 The full server source code is available from: https://github.com/AthenZ/athenz/tree/master/examples/go/centralized-use-case/server Server Import Dependency Update \u00b6 First you need to update your go client to import the zms client library. import ( \"github.com/AthenZ/athenz/clients/go/zms\" ) Authorization Checks \u00b6 Before any authorization calls, we're going to check to make sure our request contains the Athenz principal token: const authHeader = \"Athenz-Principal-Auth\" func movieHandler ( w http . ResponseWriter , r * http . Request ) { // first let's verify that we have an ntoken if r . Header [ authHeader ] == nil { http . Error ( w , \"403 - Missing NToken\" , 403 ) return } ... } } Next, the most important part is to determine the resource and action based on the given http request. Since we have a separate handler for each endpoint: http . HandleFunc ( \"/rec/v1/movie\" , movieHandler ) http . HandleFunc ( \"/rec/v1/tvshow\" , tvshowHandler ) each function knows exactly what the resource and the action is. Finally, we are going to contact ZMS for the authorization check. func movieHandler ( w http . ResponseWriter , r * http . Request ) { ... // let's generate our resource value which is the // <provider domain>:<entity value> resource := providerDomain + \":rec.movie\" // let's check with ZMS if the principal is authorized if ! authorizeRequest ( r . Header [ authHeader ][ 0 ], resource , \"read\" ) { http . Error ( w , \"403 - Unauthorized access\" , 403 ) return } io .

The required steps to setup the environment for provider and tenant services to support decentralized access control are as follows: System administrator creates the provider and tenant domains. Tenant Domain administrator generates a public/private key pair and registers a service in its domain. Provider Domain administrator creates a role and policy that grants access to the given role with configured action and resource. Provider Domain administrator adds the Tenant Service to the role to grant access. Provider Domain administrator installs Athenz Policy Engine Updater (ZPU) on the hosts that will be running the provider service. ZPU must be configured with the provider domain name and setup to run as a cron job to periodically download the latest policy files for the server/provider domain. Tenant Domain administrator installs the private key on the host that will be running the client/tenant service. Required Components \u00b6 To support centralized access control in your applications, you only need to install and configure all Athenz components: ZMS and ZTS servers along with the Athenz UI. ZPE Policy updater needs to be install on the target service host. Please follow these guides to make sure you have all of these components up and running in your environment: ZMS Server ZTS Server UI Server On the provider service's host only install ZPU: ZPU Utility To build the client and servlet components of this example, you need to download and install Oracle JDK 8, Apache Maven and Git client if you don't already have these available on your box: Oracle Java Platform JDK 8 Apache Maven Git client Service Definition \u00b6 Let's first define our service that needs to be Athenz protected. We have a simple recommendation service that returns either a movie or tv show for the caller. It has two endpoints: GET /rec/v1/movie GET /rec/v1/tvshow So in this first release we just want to protect access to these endpoints. We're going to get large number of requests per second so contacting ZMS server for centralized authorization checks is not an option. Instead, we have decided to use Athenz' decentralized authorization model. Resource Definition \u00b6 Defining resources and actions the principals are authorized to execute is one of the most important tasks in the authorization process. Based on our endpoints, it's expected that we'll have 2 general resources: movie tvshow The resources are referenced in their own domain namespace. So those are valid if your domain is specifically created to support this recommendation service only. But's lets assume we might add rental support later, so we need to make sure the policies are based on service specific resources. So we'll define our resources as: rec.movie rec.tvshow Support action for these resources would be read . We can extend our authorization policies later on if we need to introduce other actions - such as write or list as we add more functionality into our service. Athenz Management Setup \u00b6 Once we have defined what our resources and actions are, we can create their respective client and server (also commonly referred as tenant and provider) roles and policies in Athenz. Go to Athenz UI and login with your account which should have system administrator access. Follow the instructions in the following guide to setup the required access control: Access Control Setup Code Changes \u00b6 Both the client and servlet implementors need to make changes in their respective code bases to support decentralized authorization checks. The client needs to make sure to retrieve its Access Token from ZTS Service and submit that as part of its request, while the servlet needs to carry out the authorization check based on that Access Token to determine if it request should be processed or not. Client Changes \u00b6 The full client source code is available from: https://github.com/AthenZ/athenz/tree/master/examples/java/decentralized-use-case/client Client Project Dependency Update \u00b6 First you need to update your Java project pom.xml file to indicate the dependency on the Athenz auth_core and zts java client libraries. Checkout the Maven Central Athenz Cert Refresher Package and Maven Central ZTS Java Client Package pages to make sure you're using the latest release version: <dependency> <groupId>com.yahoo.athenz</groupId> <artifactId>athenz-cert-refresher</artifactId> <version>VERSION-NUMBER</version> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>com.yahoo.athenz</groupId> <artifactId>athenz-zts-java-client</artifactId> <version>VERSION-NUMBER</version> </dependency> Obtaining Access Tokens from ZTS Server \u00b6 The service should obtain an X509 certificate that will be used for authentication with Athenz.

If the ZTS Server is running with a self-signed certificate, we need to generate a truststore for the java http client to use when communicating with the ZTS Server. From your ZTS Server installation, copy the zts_cert.pem file from the athenz-zts-X.Y/var/zts_server/certs directory into the same directory where the client access token utility is saved (previous step) and execute the following commands: $ keytool -importcert -noprompt -alias zts -keystore zts_truststore.jks -file zts_cert.pem -storepass athenz Invalid Access Without accessToken \u00b6 For this test case we'll just use the curl client directly: $ curl http://localhost:8080/athenz-data/rec/v1/movie <html> ... <title>Error 403 Forbidden - No Athenz accessToken provided in request</title> ... </html> Movie Editor Access \u00b6 Movie service can successfully access /rec/v1/movie endpoint: $ java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore = ./zts_truststore.jks -cp ./example-java-client-access-token-1.0.jar com.yahoo.athenz.example.accesstoken.HttpExampleClient -t ./zts_truststore.jks -p athenz -s movie -p ./movie_private.pem -d recommend -pr movie_editors -z https://<zts-server>:8443/zts/v1 -u http://localhost:8080/athenz-data/rec/v1/movie Successful response: Name: Slap Shot ; Director: George Roy Hill Movie service does not have access to /rec/v1/tvshow endpoint: $ java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore = ./zts_truststore.jks -cp ./example-java-client-access-token-1.0.jar com.yahoo.athenz.example.accesstoken.HttpExampleClient -t ./zts_truststore.jks -p athenz -s movie -p ./movie_private.pem -d recommend -pr movie_editors -z https://<zts-server>:8443/zts/v1 -u http://localhost:8080/athenz-data/rec/v1/tvshow Request was forbidden - not authorized TvShow Editor Access \u00b6 TvShow service can successfully access /rec/v1/tvshow endpoint: $ java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore = ./zts_truststore.jks -cp ./example-java-client-access-token-1.0.jar com.yahoo.athenz.example.accesstoken.HttpExampleClient -t ./zts_truststore.jks -p athenz -s tvshow -p ./tvshow_private.pem -d recommend -pr tvshow_editors -z https://<zts-server>:8443/zts/v1 -u http://localhost:8080/athenz-data/rec/v1/tvshow Successful response: Name: Middle ; Channel: ABC TvShow service does not have access to /rec/v1/movie endpoint: $ java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore = ./zts_truststore.jks -cp ./example-java-client-access-token-1.0.jar com.yahoo.athenz.example.accesstoken.HttpExampleClient -t ./zts_truststore.jks -p athenz -s tvshow -p ./tvshow_private.pem -d recommend -pr tvshow_editors -z https://<zts-server>:8443/zts/v1 -u http://localhost:8080/athenz-data/rec/v1/movie Request was forbidden - not authorized Site Editor Access \u00b6 Site service has access to both /rec/v1/tvshow and /rec/v1/movie endpoints: $ java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore = ./zts_truststore.jks -cp ./example-java-client-access-token-1.0.jar com.yahoo.athenz.example.accesstoken.HttpExampleClient -t ./zts_truststore.jks -p athenz -s site -p ./site_private.pem -d recommend -pr full_access -z https://<zts-server>:8443/zts/v1 -u http://localhost:8080/athenz-data/rec/v1/movie Successful response: Name: Slap Shot ; Director: George Roy Hill $ java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore = ./zts_truststore.jks -cp ./example-java-client-access-token-1.0.jar com.yahoo.athenz.example.accesstoken.HttpExampleClient -t ./zts_truststore.jks -p athenz -s site -p ./site_private.pem -k v0 -d recommend -pr full_access -z https://<zts-server>:8443/zts/v1 -u http://localhost:8080/athenz-data/rec/v1/tvshow Successful response: Name: Middle ; Channel: ABC Other Test Cases \u00b6 Now you can modify the movie_editos, tvshow_editors, and site_editors roles in the recommend domain to add and remove the defined services.

Prerequisites \u00b6 Athenz running locally on docker Steps \u00b6 As part of local set up, an example domain by the name \"athenz\" is created and \"athenz-admin\" user is added as a domain administrator of that domain. Please refer to concepts to understand more about domains. To see the workflow of obtaining a service identity certificate from Athenz, please use following steps - Download latest Athenz Utils from Maven Central (click on the Browse button, choose the latest version directory and then download the athenz-utils-$latestVer-bin.tar.gz file) & add it in the current shell PATH variable. Below $athenzUtilsLocation denotes the path where file is downloaded from Maven Central. tar -xf $athenzUtilsLocation /athenz-utils- $latestVer -bin.tar.gz -C $athenzUtilsLocation export PATH = $athenzUtilsLocation /athenz-utils- $latestVer /bin/ ` uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' ` : $PATH Create a public private key pair, register the new service and its public key in Athenz Management Service. Athenz Management Service (ZMS) is running inside a docker container exposed over local port 4443. mkdir -p docker/sample/example-service openssl genrsa -out docker/sample/example-service/athenz.example-service.key.pem 4096 2 > /dev/null openssl rsa -pubout -in docker/sample/example-service/athenz.example-service.key.pem -out docker/sample/example-service/athenz.example-service.pub.pem zms-cli -z https://127.0.0.1:4443/zms/v1 -cert docker/sample/domain-admin/team_admin_cert.pem -key docker/sample/domain-admin/team_admin_key.pem \\ -d athenz add-service example-service v0 docker/sample/example-service/athenz.example-service.pub.pem Now to obtain a service identity certificate, first domain admin needs to authorize a provider. Athenz uses a generalized model for service providers to launch other service identities in an authorized way through a callback-based verification model. For more details please refer to copper argos In this case we will be using Athenz Token Service itself as a provider. In production, it can be any provider like Kubernetes, Openstack, AWS EC2 etc. Domain administrators have a full control over which provider they can authorize to launch their domains' services.

Athenz also provides the capability to automatically assign an expiry date for any principal for a configured role or all roles if the expiry day is configured at the domain level. There are separate limits for user and service principals. The administrator may decide to configure a limit only for user members but not for service principals to avoid any possible service outages when they fail to review and extend service principals' memberships. Athenz can send email notifications to all principals and the domain administrators when access is about to expire. See the Email Notifications section to enable notifications. Role Level Expiry Support \u00b6 The domain administrator may specify a maximum expiry day setting for a specific role: zms-cli -d <domain-name> set-role-member-expiry-days <role-name> <user-member-expiry-days> zms-cli -d <domain-name> set-role-service-expiry-days <role-name> <service-member-expiry-days> If the domain administrator has specified a user max expiry days of 30 to db_reader_access role, then all user members will automatically have an expiration value of 30 days from the current time. If the domain administrator has specified a value longer than 30 days or no expiry, then it will be reduced to 30 days from the current time. However, if the domain administrator specified expiration of fewer than 30 days (e.g. 7 days), then it will be honored and not extended to 30 days. If the domain administrator specifies a shorter limit on an already configured role, for example reducing from 30 to 15 days, then the server will iterate through all members and reduce the expiration to 15 days from the current time based on the configured limit (either user or service principals depending on the setting being changed).

Athenz has implementation of several authorities that support variety of authentication methods. The system administrator may decide to configure and use one of the provided authorities or implement a completely new one to satisfy their requirements. Authority Work \u00b6 The job of the Authority is authenticate a specific request and, if valid, generate and return an object representing the authenticated Principal. The Authority interface is defined in the following file: Authority The system administrator can configure a list of authorities for supporting principal authentication. During startup, the server will call the initialize() method for all configured authorities. If the authority requires access to any of the service public keys registered within Athenz, then it needs to implement the AuthorityKeyStore interface as well and provide an implementation of the setKeyStore() method. The server implements the KeyStore interface and will automatically call the setKeyStore() method to pass its implementation to the authority. AuthorityKeyStore When processing a request the server goes through the list of authorities in their configured order and processes until it receives a successful principal object. As soon as a successful response is received from the authenticate method, the server will stop processing other authorities in the list and continue with the authorization check. If no authority returns an authenticated principal, the server returns 401 Unauthenticated response to the calling client. The Authority defines if the authentication details are based on a header or certificate: getCredSource() . If the returned value is HEADER then the Athenz server will retrieve the header, identified by the value returned by the getHeader() method, that the authority is looking for and if a value is present, it will call the authenticate() method to see if the request contains valid credentials or not. The returned principal object contains the Authority object that was used for authentication. This allows the Athenz servers, if necessary, to decide if further checks and/or restrictions are necessary. Configuration \u00b6 Both ZMS and ZTS Servers expect to find the list of authority classes in their respective system properties: ZMS: athenz.zms.authority_classes ZTS: athenz.zts.authority_classes The value of the property must be a comma separated (no spaces) list of authority class names. For example, -Dathenz.zms.authority_classes=com.yahoo.athenz.auth.impl.PrincipalAuthority,com.yahoo.athenz.auth.impl.UserAuthority If you're installing and running Athenz services using the binary packages provided, you can configure the list of authorities in the conf/zms_server/zms.properties or conf/zts_server/zts.properties files for ZMS and ZTS servers respectively: athenz.zms.authority_classes=com.yahoo.athenz.auth.impl.PrincipalAuthority,com.yahoo.athenz.auth.impl.UserAuthority athenz.zts.authority_classes=com.yahoo.athenz.auth.impl.PrincipalAuthority,com.yahoo.athenz.auth.impl.UserAuthority Provided Authorities \u00b6 Here is the list of Athenz provided authorities with brief description of each one. Unix User Authority \u00b6 Class: com.yahoo.athenz.auth.impl.UserAuthority This authority uses the Unix pam login profile to authenticate users. The user that the ZMS process runs as must have read access to the /etc/shadow file. There are two options available: Run the process as root using sudo. This is only recommended for a local development installation. Create a special Unix group that has read access to the /etc/shadow file and set the user that the ZMS process will be running as a member of that group. User Authority is typically not allowed to carry out any authorized operation. It is required that the user first must obtain an X509 certificate for his/her identity and use that certificate to carry out the authorized request. Principal Authority \u00b6 Class: com.yahoo.athenz.auth.impl.PrincipalAuthority This authority uses Athenz generated NTokens. It accepts NTokens, parses to extract the signature and the private key details that were used to sign this token: domain, service, and key id. Then it requests the corresponding public key and verifies the signature. Principal Authority is one of primary authorities in Athenz. It is used to validate NTokens that were issued by ZTS and service tokens generated by SIA Providers. By default, when authenticating an NToken, the authority validates that the IP address in the NToken matches to the IP address of the request. This provides extra security that changes to domain data are not carried out by NTokens that possible have been stolen. Kerberos Authority \u00b6 Class: com.yahoo.athenz.auth.impl.KerberosAuthority This authority supports environments with Kerberos servers. This authority expects to find the Kerberos Ticket in the Authorization header. There are several system properties that must be set for proper initialization of this authority: athenz.auth.kerberos.service_principal - Kerberos service principal athenz.auth.kerberos.keytab_location - Kerberos keytab location athenz.auth.kerberos.jaas_cfg_section - JAAS configuration section. If using a jaas.conf file then that path is specified by the system property java.security.auth.login.config For full details check out the implementation of the Kerberos Authority: Kerberos Authority Certificate Authority \u00b6 Class: com.yahoo.athenz.auth.impl.CertificateAuthority The certificate authority expects that the server has been configured with a truststore that only includes the CA cert that it tasked with issuing principal certificates. The Authority only looks at the CommonName component of the certificate and expects it to include the service name in the {domain}.{service} format. For example: Certificate Subject DN: c=US;o=Some Athenz Company;cn=sports.fantasy The authenticated principal in this case is service fantasy in domain sports . LDAP Authority \u00b6 Class: com.yahoo.athenz.auth.impl.LDAPAuthority Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authority uses the bind operation to authenticate users. The authentication mechanism used is simple where plain text username and passwords are used. The hostname , port number and base DN property of the LDAP server needs to be provided.

The latter can reference those roles having access to specified resources. Athenz supports service authentication with two types of credentials: X.509 Certificates (preferred approach) Instructions Public/Private Key Pairs Before you can register the service identity, you'll need to generate keys. In this section we'll cover how to create the keys and register the service identity. Key Generation \u00b6 The registration process requires the domain administrator to generate a private/public RSA key pair (must be at least 2048 bit) for the service. The following are the keys and the services that use those keys: private key - The SIA server/utility uses the private key to generate a ServiceToken identifying the service. public key - ZMS/ZTS then use the public key to validate the ServiceToken generated by SIA. The openssl command-line utility is used to generate the key pair: $ umask 077 $ openssl genrsa -out service_private.key 2048 $ openssl rsa -in service_private.key -pubout > service_public.key If using the zms-cli client utility to register the service identity, the public key file must have an extension of .pem or .key. Private Keys \u00b6 The private key file must be installed on all hosts where the service will be running. The reason the use of X.509 Certificates is the preferred approach is because to securely install the private key on all hosts presents a challenge. Each key pair has a key identifier that will be included in the generated ServiceTokens as the value of the k component. If the service\u2019s private key has been compromised or the service has a policy to periodically rotate the keys, the service administrator will generate a new key pair, remove the public key with the old identifier, and register a new public key with a different key identifier. Typically, a service would start with \"0\" as its first identifier and increment when required. Key Rotation \u00b6 If the service\u2019s private key has been compromised or the service has a policy to periodically rotate the keys, the service administrator will generate a new key pair, remove the public key with identifier 0 and register a new public key with a different key identifier. As mentioned above, the key identifier is included in generated Service Tokens as the value of the k component. See the instructions below how to add and delete public keys for a service. Service Identity Registration \u00b6 To register a new service identity, select your domain in Athenz UI and choose the Services tab.

If the principal is requesting a role certificate with a smaller expiry that 360 mins configured for the domain, for example 120 mins, and there are no per-role certificate expiry settings configured, then it will be honored and the role certificate will be issued for 120 mins. You can look at the currently configured value for a specific domain using zms-cli -d <domain-name> show-domain command.

The regular role just includes list of principals that may assume that role. The delegated type specifies the trusted domain who has assumed the management of the members for that role. The delegation scenario involves two domains: The \"provider-domain\" is the domain of the service, where the policies and rules are declared, The \"tenant-domain\" (a.k.a. \"trusted-domain\") is the domain in which principals are assigned to the role. The delegation requires agreement from both domains: The provider-domain administrator specifies a role as \"delegated\" to a specific tenant-domain. The tenant-domain administrator creates a rule to assume that role and maps it to one if its local regular roles for principal membership. Definition of required roles and rules \u00b6 The keywords PROVIDER_DOMAIN , TENANT_DOMAIN , PROVIDER_ROLE and TENANT_ROLE are place-holders for the actual id's. Steps for establishing a delegated role: In the provider-domain: Create the role PROVIDER_ROLE as \"delegated\" to the domain TENANT_DOMAIN . Create various rules for PROVIDER_ROLE as usual. In the tenant-domain: Create role TENANT_ROLE Create this rule: Allow Action= assume_role Role= TENANT_ROLE Resource= PROVIDER_DOMAIN:role.PROVIDER_ROLE Assign members to \u201cTENANT_ROLE\u201d as usual. Use Case: Domain Administration Delegation \u00b6 A product team has a top level domain called sales with its configured set of administrators. They also have created a subdomain sales.api for the sales API subproduct. Since Athenz subdomains are completely independent, sales.api has its own admin role and set of administrators. However, in the case of sales product these two domains must have the same set of administrators and the product owner does not want to maintain and manage the admin role members in two places. The sales.api domain wants to delegate administration privileges to the parent sales domain. Step 1: sales.api change: create an admin role for the delegation \u00b6 Since Athenz does not allow administrators to remove or modify the admin role and policy for a domain, first we're going to create a role that will be delegated to the parent sales domain: Select Add Role link on the left side of the screen underneath the Roles tab name. Select a role type as Delegated and enter the role name and tenant-domain name: Step 2: sales.api change: create an admin policy for the delegated role \u00b6 Next we're going to create a new policy that provides the same admin privileges to the delegated sales.admin role. The admin policy uses * for the action and * for the resource. Step 3: sales change: create a policy to assume the sales.admin role \u00b6 Now, the domain administrator for sales domain must agree to assume that role by creating a special policy in its domain. The unique requirements for this policy are the action which must be set to assume_role and the resource which must be set to the full role name ({domain-name}:role.{role-name} format) that is being delegated to this domain. You have a choice to delegate the membership to any of your local roles. In this use case since we want to have a single domain admin role, we're going to delegate the sales.admin role from the sales.api subdomain to the admin role in sales domain. Step 4: verify delegated role membership in sales.api domain \u00b6 First, let's check the members of the admin role in the sales domain - it shows two principals as members: user.janedoe and user.johndoe. For delegated roles, Athenz Web UI automatically retrieves the members of the role in the tenant-domain that this role is delegated to and displays them as members without the capability to modify the list.

Using Service Registered Public/Private Key Pairs \u00b6 In this method, we're creating a public/private key pair where the caller holds on to the private key and registers the public key in Athenz.

The ZTS Server validates the service token using the registered public key and issues the X.509 certificate for the service. When using this approach we strongly recommend using a different private key per instance (you generate the private key on the host itself and make sure it's secure and never leaves the host) so that each instance has a unique private key/certificate pair.

Athenz supports service authentication with two types of credentials: X.509 Certificates (preferred approach) Public/Private Key Pairs Instructions To contact Athenz Services (ZMS/ZTS) or other Athenz Enabled services, the client service must first obtain an Athenz CA issued X.509 certificate. In this section we'll cover how to register the service identity and obtain X.509 certificates based on what environment your service will be running in. Use Case 1: Service Running in AWS EC2 \u00b6 If the service is running in AWS, Service Identity Agent (SIA) running on the instance is responsible for generating a private key for the service and obtaining a x.509 certificate from ZTS Service. The files are located in the following locations: private-key: /var/lib/sia/keys/<domain>.<service>.key.pem certificate: /var/lib/sia/certs/<domain>.<service>.cert.pem The certificate is valid for 30 days and SIA agent automatically will refresh the certificate daily. Follow these steps for full details how to configure SIA agent running in AWS as part of the foundation image. Use Case 2: Service running on-prem within an Athenz Enabled Framework (K8S) \u00b6 If the service is running within an Athenz enabled framework then it must already have access to service identity x.509 certificate that was generated for the service. Refer to the documentation provided by the framework to see where the files are located. Use Case 3: Service Running in AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) \u00b6 If the service is running in AWS ECS, Service Identity Agent (SIA) included in your image is responsible for generating a private key for the service and obtaining a x.509 certificate from ZTS Service. The files are located in the following locations: private-key: /var/lib/sia/keys/<domain>.<service>.key.pem certificate: /var/lib/sia/certs/<domain>.<service>.cert.pem The certificate is valid for 30 days and SIA agent automatically will refresh the certificate daily. Follow these steps for full details how to configure SIA agent running in AWS as part of your image. Use Case 4: Service Running in AWS Lambda Function \u00b6 If the service is running in AWS Lambda function, the function being invoked will be responsible for generating a private key and then a csr for its request.

Domain Registration \u00b6 Identify your Athenz domain before you can proceed by using Athenz UI. You may create a top-level domain or a sub domain using Athenz UI or zms-cli. Only Athenz System Administrators can create top level domains (members of the sys.auth domain's admin role). To create a top-level domain using zms-cli run the following: zms-cli add-domakn <domain-name> <unique-product-id> <domain-admins separated by space> If you already have top-level domain and need to create a sub domain using Athenz UI: click the \"Create\u201d link next to \"My Domains\" label in the top right corner and then click on \u201cSub Domain\u201d tab and follow the on screen instruction. Or using zms-cli: zms-cli add-doman <top-doman.sub-domain-name> <domain-admins separated by space> AWS Account ID Registration \u00b6 To register an AWS Account with a domain, run the following command: zms-cli -d <domain-name> set-aws-account <aws-account-id> Athenz Service Identity Registration \u00b6 Create a service identity for your AWS EC2 instances in your Athenz domain. This full service identity name <domain>.<service> will be the IAM role name that you will need to create in AWS IAM and set up a trust relationship with your EC2 Instance Role. In the Athenz UI, select your domain, select the Services tab and then choose Add a Service link in the top left corner. You must provide a service name and an optional description for your service. Athenz Service Identity Authorization \u00b6 Before ZTS can validate and issue X.509 TLS Certificates to the AWS EC2 instance, it must validate that the service owner has authorized its service to be launched by AWS EC2 Provider. In the Athenz UI select your service that was created in the previous step and click on the icon in the Providers column: Then, click on the Allow button to authorize your service to be launched by AWS EC2 provider. IAM Role Setup \u00b6 There are two IAM roles required for instances to obtain Athenz X.509 certificates: EC2 Instance Profile Role Athenz Service Identity Assume Role It is assumed that at this point you have already configured the first EC2 Instance Profile IAM Role that your EC2 instance will be launched with. The second Athenz Service Identity IAM Assume Role must be created and must have the <domain>.<service> name. This role will not have any permissions but instead will have a trust relationship with your EC2 instance role such that your EC2 instance role can assume this role. In the AWS Console, select IAM from the Services drop down and then click on the Roles link in the left sidebar. Choose the Create Role button. Under the AWS Service type, select EC2 , then EC2 again for the use case and finally choose Next: Permissions button in the bottom right corner. In the Attach permissions policy screen do not choose any permissions and just click on the Next: Review button in the bottom right corner to continue. Specify the Role name in the <domain>.<service> format and choose Create Role to complete the process. In the Roles list view, choose the role just created and choose the Trust Relationships tab. Click on Edit trust relationship button and append a block containing the following policy to the Statement block (Replace the <account-id> and <ec2-instance-role> values with their corresponding values for your environment: { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": { \"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/<ec2-instance-role>\" }, \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\" } Once correctly updated, your EC2 instance role must appear in the Trusted entities table: Setup for Services with Region Specific Instance Profile Roles \u00b6 The IAM Role setup is identical when you have the same service being deployed in multiple regions with role names that are specific to each region. Since IAM roles are global, you only need to create a single Athenz IAM Role in the <domain>.<service> format. Then, when you're setting up your trust relationship, you'll authorize all your region specific profile roles to have the capability to assume the Athenz <domain>.<service> role. Installing SIA \u00b6 The AWS SIA source is part of the Athenz project and can be found in: provider/aws/sia-ec2 Follow the readme for instructions on how to install it. SIA Configuration Setup \u00b6 When building your image, you can include the following configuration file called sia_config in the /etc/sia directory. It must include the following required fields: { \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"service\": \"<service name>\", \"accounts\": [ { \"domain\": \"<domain name>\", \"account\": \"<aws account id associated with domain name>\" } ] } The domain/account/service values here must match to the IAM Role created earlier. For example, if the service identity name is api in domain sports whose corresponding aws account id is 123456789 , then the sia_config file will be as follows: { \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"service\": \"api\", \"accounts\": [ { \"domain\": \"sports\", \"account\": \"123456789\" } ] } Private Key File Ownership \u00b6 By default SIA agent runs as root and the private key is only readable by root. If your service is running as another user, you can configure SIA agent to automatically change the ownership of the private key file to the configured user. For example, if you want the private key to be owned by ec2-user , then your sia_config configuration file would be as follows: { \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"service\": \"api\", \"accounts\": [ { \"domain\": \"sports\", \"account\": \"123456789\", \"user\": \"ec2-user\" } ] } Private Key and Certificate Setup \u00b6 By default, the private key for the service identity is available in the /var/lib/sia/keys directory and has the name <domain>.<service>.key.pem . The private key is in PKCS#1 format. The corresponding X.509 certificate is in the /var/lib/sia/certs directory and has the name <domain>.<service>.cert.pem . The certificate is valid for 30 days and will be refreshed automatically by SIA every day. It is the responsibility of the application owner to update their container/application to refresh and use the latest certificate before it expires. In the same /var/lib/sia/certs directory SIA will also generate the Athenz CA certificate file called ca.cert.pem . Role Certificate Support \u00b6 In addition to requesting Athenz service identity certificate, SIA provides the capability to request Athenz Role Certificates as well. If you want to change the default behavior or request SIA to automatically retrieve role certificates for your service, as part of building your ami image, you can include the following additional fields in the configuration file: { \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"service\": \"<service name>\", \"accounts\": [ { \"domain\": \"<domain name>\", \"account\": \"<aws account id associated with domain name>\", \"roles\": { \"<role-domain1>:role.<role-name1>\": { }, \"<role-domain2>:role.<role-name2>\": { } } } ] } The role certificates will also be stored in the /var/lib/sia/certs directory and have the name of <role-domain1>:role.<role-name1>.cert.pem . They are also valid for 30 days and SIA will automatically refresh them once a day. Setup Without SIA Configuration File \u00b6 If a property deploying their service in AWS meets the following 2 requirements: does not need any role certificates to be retrieved by SIA automatically has the option to name their EC2 instance role then they have the option for a simpler setup without including a sia configuration file in their image. In this model, the property would name their EC2 instance role as <domain>.<service>-service . The property must still follow the full steps as described in the IAM Role Setup section to setup the <domain>.<service> role, but the requirement to have a sia_config file is no longer present. When SIA is running and is not able to find the sia_config file, it will check if the instance profile arn has the <domain>.<service>-service format. If it does, then it would drop -service part to parse the rest of the string to extract the Athenz domain and service values and determine the assume role name that it needs to fetch temporary credentials for before contacting ZTS Server. Non Standard Instance Profile Name \u00b6 If a property deploying their service in AWS does not have the capability to name their instance profile role name as <domain>.<service>-service due to legacy requirements, the following steps can be followed to configure SIA to use the non-standard instance profile name. The property must still follow the full steps as described in the IAM Role Setup section to setup the <domain>.<service> role and the trust relationship. The property must install a SIA config file /etc/sia/sia_config specifying the service name that will be deployed on this instance Independent Instance Profile and Role Names \u00b6 It is possible to setup only a single role within AWS IAM in the format <domain>.<service> and name the IAM profile name as <domain>.<service>-service without creating a separate role. However, there is currently no support in the AWS UI console for naming your IAM role and IAM instance profile independently. You can do this with Cloud Formation, Ansible, TF, the AWS API, or the CLI. Here is an example using the CLI - replace <domain> , <service> and <account-id> parameters with their respective values for your environment: aws iam create-role --role-name <domain>.<service> --assume-role-policy-document='{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"Service\":\"ec2.amazonaws.com\"},\"Action\":\"sts:AssumeRole\"}]}' aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name <domain>.<service>-service aws iam update-assume-role-policy --role-name <domain>.<service> --policy-document '{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"Service\":\"ec2.amazonaws.com\"},\"Action\":\"sts:AssumeRole\"},{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"AWS\":\"arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/<domain>.<service>\"},\"Action\":\"sts:AssumeRole\"}]}' aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile --instance-profile-name <domain>.<service>-service --role-name <domain>.<service> However, this model is not recommended from security perspective if your <domain>.<service> role has access to other AWS services. Temporary credentials for that role are sent to Athenz ZTS service as your authentication credentials and, as such, you do not want to expose those additional access capabilities to the ZTS Server. Troubleshooting \u00b6 SIA process outputs all of its messages to syslog, so if there are any issues with your configuration, it will be reported in syslog. You can execute: sudo grep siad /var/log/messages and see what operation sia was not able to complete successfully. The agent is configured to run every 20 seconds in case of a failure, so you'll most likely see the same block being repeated multiple times. ZTS server allows instances to obtain x.509 certificates only during the first 30 minutes after the initial bootstrap time so even if you address the configuration issues, once the 30 mins have passed, the instance will no longer be able to obtain its x.509 service identity certificate.

Typically you run the siad binary in your container and let it run continuously to register and refresh your service certificate daily since systemd does not run in a typical docker image. If you only want to run siad as a command line utility that just registers and refreshes the service and role certificates when executed, you can use the following command line options (Register must be called once within the first 30 mins when the instance is bootstrapped): Instance Register: /usr/sbin/siad -cmd post Service Certificate Refresh: /usr/sbin/siad -cmd rotate Role Certificate Refresh: /usr/sbin/siad -cmd rolecert SIA Configuration Setup \u00b6 When building your container image, you must include the following configuration file called sia_config in the /etc/sia directory. It must include the following required fields: { \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"service\": \"<service name>\", \"accounts\": [ { \"domain\": \"<domain name>\", \"account\": \"<aws account id associated with domain name>\" } ] } The domain/account/service values here must match to the IAM Role created earlier. For example, if the service identity name is api in domain sports whose corresponding aws account id is 123456789 , then the sia_config file will be as follows: { \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"service\": \"api\", \"accounts\": [ { \"domain\": \"sports\", \"account\": \"123456789\" } ] } Private Key File Ownership \u00b6 By default SIA agent runs as root and the private key is only readable by root. If your service is running as another user, you can configure SIA agent to automatically change the ownership of the private key file to the configured user. For example, if you want the private key to be owned by ec2-user , then your sia_config configuration file would be as follows: { \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"service\": \"api\", \"accounts\": [ { \"domain\": \"sports\", \"account\": \"123456789\", \"user\": \"ec2-user\" } ] } Private Key and Certificate Setup \u00b6 By default, the private key for the service identity is available in the /var/lib/sia/keys directory and has the name <domain>.<service>.key.pem . The private key is in PKCS#1 format. The corresponding X.509 certificate is in the /var/lib/sia/certs directory and has the name <domain>.<service>.cert.pem . The certificate is valid for 30 days and will be refreshed automatically by SIA every day. It is the responsibility of the application owner to update their container/application to refresh and use the latest certificate before it expires. In the same /var/lib/sia/certs directory SIA will also generate the Athenz CA certificate file called ca.cert.pem . In addition to requesting Athenz service identity certificate, SIA provides the capability to request Athenz Role Certificates as well. If you want to change the default behavior or request SIA to automatically retrieve role certificates for your service, as part of building your ami image, you can include the following additional fields in the configuration file: { \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"service\": \"<service name>\", \"accounts\": [ { \"domain\": \"<domain name>\", \"account\": \"<aws account id associated with domain name>\", \"roles\": { \"<role-domain1>:role.<role-name1>\": { }, \"<role-domain2>:role.<role-name2>\": { } } } ] } The role certificates will also be stored in the /var/lib/sia/certs directory and have the name of <role-domain1>:role.<role-name1>.cert.pem .

Instead, the function being invoked will be responsible for generating a private key and then a csr for its request. Finally, it will submit that request to the ZTS Server to retrieve its X.509 certificate which then it can use along with its generated private key to establish TLS connections to other Verizon Media Athenz enabled services. Athenz Team provides functions/methods in Go and Java programming languages to quickly generate a private key and request its corresponding X.509 certificate from ZTS Server. Important consideration when dealing with Lambda functions: The code to do this needs to prefetch and cache the certificate in a way that does not block every invocation, as minting a new certificate is somewhat expensive. The short lifetime and stateless nature of the function means it cannot rotate its certificates. It just gets new ones when needed. Java \u00b6 The following function is available in the Athenz ZTS Java Client: /** * For AWS Lambda functions generate a new private key, request a * x.509 certificate based on the requested CSR and return both to * the client in order to establish tls connections with other * Athenz enabled services. * @param domainName name of the athenz domain * @param serviceName name of the athenz service * @param account AWS account name that the function runs in * @param provider name of the provider service for AWS Lambda * @return AWSLambdaIdentity with private key and certificate */ public AWSLambdaIdentity getAWSLambdaServiceCertificate(String domainName, String serviceName, String account, String provider); For example, here is a quick program that can be compiled and packaged into lambda.jar and deployed as a Lambda function in AWS.

Uncomment the #athenz.zms.object_store_factory_class= line and set it to point to the JDBC Factory class name. It should be set to: athenz.zms.object_store_factory_class=com.yahoo.athenz.zms.store.impl.JDBCObjectStoreFactory Uncomment the #athenz.zms.jdbcstore= line and set it to point to your MySQL Server instance. For example if your DB Server is running on a host called db1.athenz.com, then your line would be: athenz.zms.jdbc_store=jdbc:mysql://db1.athenz.com:3306/zms_server Uncomment the #athenz.zms.jdbc_user= line and set it to the user configured to have full access over zms server database: athenz.zms.jdbc_user=zms_admin Uncomment the #athenz.zms.jdbc_password= line and set it to the configured password the for the jdbc user with full access: athenz.zms.jdbc_password=rdvXC7wgvm3g Storing the password in property file is not secure. The more secure approach is to use a Key Management Store like HashiCorp Vault to store your passwords. Athenz provides a PrivateKeyStoreFactory interface for accessing secrets from your key management store. The recommended approach would to write your own implementation of this interface and configure ZMS server to use that factory to fetch the password for your database access. ZMS Server expect the private key store factory implementation class name in its athenz.zms.private_key_store_factory_class system property. Refer to Private Key Store section for full details how to implement your private key store. When storing the jdbc user password for your database access in your key management store with a given keyname like athenz.admin_db_password and using your own implementation of the PrivateKeyStoreFactory, then the value of the athenz.zms.jdbc_password property would be the key name. For example: athenz.zms.jdbc_password=athenz.admin_db_password The password is retrieved using the getApplicationSecret() of your private key store class that takes keyName ( athenz.admin_db_password in this case) as input and returns key value that is your configured password. Private Key and Server X509 Certificate Setup \u00b6 Development Environment \u00b6 To run ZMS Server, the system administrator must generate the keys and make necessary changes to the configuration settings. $ cd athenz-zms-X.Y $ bin/setup_dev_zms.sh Running this setup script completes the following two tasks: Generate a unique private key that ZMS Server will use to sign any NTokens it issues Generate a self-signed X509 certificate for ZMS Server HTTPS support Production Environment \u00b6 Private Key \u00b6 Generate a unique private key that ZMS Server will use to sign any NTokens it issues. From the athenz-zms-X.Y directory execute the following commands: $ cd var/zms_server/keys $ openssl genrsa -out zms_private.pem 2048 If you have multiple ZMS servers in your environment, your private key must be stored in your key management store and securely installed on all hosts where ZMS servers will be running in the specified directory. Server X509 Certificate \u00b6 While it is still possible to generate and use a self-signed X509 certificate for ZMS Servers, it is recommended to purchase one for your production server from a well known certificate authority. Having such a certificate installed on your ZMS Servers will no longer require to distribute the server's CA certificate to other hosts (e.g. ZTS Servers, Hosts running ZPU). Follow the instructions provided by the Certificate Authority that you're going to purchase your certificate from to generate your private key and then the Certificate Request (CSR). Once you have received your X509 certificate, we just need to add that certificate along with its private key to a keystore for Jetty use. From the athenz-zms-X.Y directory execute the following command: $ openssl pkcs12 -export -out zms_keystore.pkcs12 -in zms_cert.pem -inkey zms_key.pem User Authentication \u00b6 For a user to authenticate himself/herself in ZMS, the server must have the appropriate authentication authority implementation configured. By default, ZMS enables the following two authorities: Unix User Authority - using pam login profile to authenticate users Principal Authority - validating Principal Tokens that are issued when users authenticate using their unix login password. The server also provides other authorities - e.g. Kerberos, TLS Certificate that are not enabled by default. Since the default setup includes Unix Authority, the user that the ZMS process runs as must have read access to the /etc/shadow file. There are two options available: Run the process as root using sudo. This is only recommended for a local development installation. Create a special Unix group that has read access to the /etc/shadow file and set the user that the ZMS process will be running as a member of that group. Checkout the Principal Authentication section for full details on authorities. To add your own authentication authority, modify the athenz.zms.authority_classes=com.yahoo.athenz.auth.impl.PrincipalAuthority,com.yahoo.athenz.auth.impl.UserAuthority line and include comma separated list of authority implementation classes to support. System Administrators \u00b6 When running the server very first time, ZMS Server automatically creates the required domains and sets the running user as the system administrator. The system administrators are the only ones authorized to create top level domains in Athenz. Before running the server very first time, you can configure the set of system administrators by following these steps: $ cd athenz-zms-X.Y $ vi conf/zms_server/zms.properties Modify the athenz.zms.domain_admin=user.admin line and include comma separated list of unix user ids that should be set as Athenz system administrators. e.g. athenz.zms.domain_admin=user.joe,user.john Start/Stop ZMS Server \u00b6 Start the ZMS Server by executing: $ cd athenz-zms-X.Y $ sudo -E bin/zms start See the User Authentication section above regarding an alternative solution of starting ZMS Server without using sudo. If using the Unix Authority to authenticate users against their unix password, make sure the user that the ZMS Server process is running as has read access to the /etc/shadow file. Based on the sample configuration file provided, ZMS Server will be listening on port 4443.

The authorization (AuthZ) system shown in the figure below consists of several logical subsystems, which we will elaborate on in the following section. ZMS (authZ Management System) \u00b6 ZMS is the source of truth for domains, roles, and policies for centralized authorization. In addition to allowing CRUD operations on the basic entities, ZMS provides an API to replicate the entities, per domain, to ZTS. ZMS supports a centralized call to check if a principal has access to a resource both for internal management system checks, as well as a simple centralized deployment. Because ZMS supports service identities, ZMS can authenticate services. For centralized authorization, ZMS may be the only Athenz subsystem that you need to interact with. ZTS (authZ Token System) \u00b6 ZTS, the authentication token service, is only needed to support decentralized or data plane functionality. In many ways, ZTS is like a local replica of ZMS's data to check a principal's authentication and confirm membership in roles within a domain. The authentication is in the form of a signed ZToken that can be presented to any decentralized service that wants to authorize access efficiently. Multiple ZTS instances can be distributed to different locations as needed to scale for issuing tokens. SIA (Service Identity Agent) Provider \u00b6 SIA (Service Identity Agent) Provider is part of the container, although likely built with Athenz libraries. As services are authenticated by their private keys, the job of the SIA Provider is to generate a X509 certificate and sign it with the given private key so that the service can present that certificate to ZMS/ZTS as its identity credentials. The corresponding public key must be registered in ZMS so Athenz services can validate the signature. ZPE (AuthZ Policy Engine) \u00b6 Like ZTS, ZPE, the authorization policy engine is only needed to support decentralized authorization. ZPE is the subsystem of Athenz that evaluates policies for a set of roles to yield an allowed or a denied response. ZPE is a library that your service calls and only refers to a local policy cache for your services domain (a small amount of data). ZPU (AuthZ PolicyEngine Updater) \u00b6 Like ZTS and ZPE, ZPU is only needed to support decentralized authorization.

Getting Software \u00b6 Download latest ZMS Client utility binary release from Maven Central : click on the Browse button, choose the latest version directory and then download the athenz-utils-<latest-version>-bin.tar.gz . $ tar xvfz athenz-utils-X.Y-bin.tar.gz Prerequisites \u00b6 Before you can use the ZMS client utility, you need to have asked the Athenz administrators to create your top level domain. Getting Help \u00b6 The help argument for the utility will display all commands available through utility. $ zms-cli help To get additional details about a specific command: $ zms - cli help [ command ] For example, to get complete details on how to add a domain including examples: $ zms-cli help add-domain Specifying ZMS Environments \u00b6 Use the -z option to point to the required environment for executing commands. $ zms-cli -z https://zms-server.athenzcompany.com:4443/zms/v1 -d athenz show-domain How the ZMS Client Authenticates \u00b6 The Athenz ZMS server requires the user to provide its UserToken or use a User certificate and private key for MTLS to authenticate with ZMS (depending on the Principal Authority used). ZMS will then authorize the request based on the configured authority. Listing registered domains in Athenz \u00b6 To find out what domains have been provisioned in Athenz, run the following: $ zms-cli list-domain The list-domain command also takes an optional prefix argument to filter the domains and only return those that start with the specified string. For example, if the user wants to list only the domains that have been configured in the athenz product domain, he/she will run the following command: $ zms-cli list-domain athenz domains: - athenz - athenz.ci - athenz.qa Displaying Administrators for a Product Domain \u00b6 To view the full list of administrators for a given domain, run the following: $ zms-cli -d <domain-name> show-role admin For example, to view the Athenz system administrators for the domain media.news : $ zms-cli -d media.news show-role admin Adding Domains \u00b6 The Top Level Product Domains in ZMS are provisioned by Athenz administrators. Once the Product Domain has been created, the designated domain administrators can create any subdomains as necessary. To create a new domain, the administrator uses the add-domain command: $ zms-cli add-domain <product sub domain> [ <admin1> <admin2> ... ] Parameters \u00b6 <domain> The name of the domain to be added, which could either be a product domain or a subdomain. For example, to add a subdomain called storage in the athenz domain, the value for <domain> would be athenz.storage . The parent domain must exist before a subdomain can be created. The domain name can only include any letters, digits and the '-' character. The maximum length of the domain name (including all subdomain parts) is 256 bytes. [<admin1> ...] A space-separated list of administrators for the domain. The user creating the domain is automatically added as an administrator. Examples \u00b6 If user joe executes the command below, the product domain coretech is created and will include user.joe as an administrator: $ zms-cli add-domain coretech When user joe executes the command below, the sub domain athenz.ci is created and will have the administrators yby.joe , yby.john , and yby.jane : $ zms-cli add-domain athenz.ci yby.john yby.jane Registering Personal Domains \u00b6 ZMS supports Personal Domains. These domains are provisioned for users in the User user domain and have the same functionality as Product Domains in Athenz. The Personal Domain uses the syntax user.<user-id> and can have configured number of subdomains (default 2). For example, if your user ID is joe and you'd like to create a Personal Domain, you would run the following command: $ zms-cli add-domain user.joe Then, to create a subdomain called athenz-test in your Personal Domain, you would run the following command: $ zms-cli add-domain user.joe.athenz-test If the user wants to list only his/her personal domains that have been registered, he/she will run the following command: $ zms-cli list-domain user.<user-id> Adding and Removing Administrators \u00b6 Domain administrators are the principals listed as members of the role admin . When you create a domain, the role and corresponding policy role are created. Administrators can manage the list of current domain administrators by adding or removing members in the admin role. To add one or more administrators: $ zms-cli -d <domain> add-member admin <user1> [ <user2> ... ] To remove existing domain administrators: $ zms-cli -d <domain> delete-member admin <user1> [ <user2> ... ] ZMS allows you to remove yourself from the admin role. Once you 've been removed, you' ll need to ask another domain administrator to re - add you to the `admin` role . Adding a Regular Role \u00b6 To add new regular role to a domain, the administrator will execute the following zms-cli command: $ zms-cli -d <domain> add-regular-role <role> <member> [ <member> ... ] Parameters <domain> The name of the domain that the new role belongs to. <role> The name of the new role to be added. <member> [<member> ...] A space-separated list of members for the role. At least one member must be specified. If the member is a regular user, then user's id must be prefixed with user. . Once the group has been created, the administrator can add and/or delete members using the add-member and delete-member commands. Example \u00b6 When the domain administrator executes the command below, a new role called readers will be added to the the domain athenz.ci will have the following members: user - user.john and service - media.sports.storage : $ zms-cli -d athenz.ci add-regular-role readers user.john media.sports.storage Managing a Group Role Membership \u00b6 To add and/or delete members to/from a given role in a domain, the administrator will execute the following zms-cli commands: $ zms-cli -d <domain> add-member <role> <member> [ <member> ... ] $ zms-cli -d <domain> delete-member <role> <member> [ <member> ... ] Parameters <domain> The name of the domain that the role belongs to. <role> The name of the role that will be modified to add or remove members. <member> [<member> ...] A space-separated list of members to be added to the role or to be removed from the role. At least one member must be specified. If the member is a regular user, the user's id must be prefixed with user. . When specifying service identities as members you must provide the full service name in then <domain-name>.<service-name> format. Example To add two new members: service \"media.sports.storage\" and user \"yby.john\", to a role called \"readers\" in the domain \"athenz\", the domain administrator will execute the following command: $ zms-cli -d athenz add-member readers yby.john media.sports.storage To delete member \"media.sports.storage\" from a role called \"writers\" in the domain \"athenz\", the domain administrator will execute the following command: $ zms-cli -d athenz delete-member writers media.sports.storage Adding a temporary Role Membership with expiration date \u00b6 To add a temporary member to a given role in a domain, the administrator will execute the following zms-cli commands: $ zms-cli -d <domain> add-temporary-member <role> <member> <expiration> Parameters <domain> The name of the domain that the role belongs to. <role> The name of the role that will be modified to add. <member> A member to be added to the role. Only one member must be specified. If the member is a regular user, the user's short id must be prefixed with user. . <expiration> Expiration date. It is expected to be in UTC timezone in the form of YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ - for example: 2017-03-02T15:04:00Z Example To add a new member: user user.john , to a role called readers in the domain sports.nhl , with expiration date set to 1PM UTC time on Sep. 3 rd , 2018, the domain administrator will execute the following command: $ zms-cli -d sports.nhl add-temporary-member readers user.john 2018-09-03T13:00:00Z Adding a Policy \u00b6 To add new policy to a domain, the administrator will execute the following zms-cli command: $ zms-cli -d <domain> add-policy <policy> [ <assertion> ] Parameters <domain> The name of the domain that the new policy belongs to. <policy> The name of the new policy to be added. [<assertion>] where <assertion> is '<effect> <action> to <role> on <resource>' The value effect must be either 'grant' or 'deny'. The action is the domain administrator defined action available for the resource (e.g. read, write, delete). The role is the name of the role this assertion applies to. The resource is the name of the resource this assertion applies to. Once the policy has been created, the administrator can add and/or delete assertions using the add-assertion and delete-assertion commands. Example When the domain administrator executes the command below, a new policy called writers will be added to the the domain athenz.ci that will grant write access to all the members of the sports_writers role on articles.sports.* : $ zms-cli -d athenz.ci add-policy writers grant write to sports_writers on 'articles.sports.*'","title":"ZMS Client Utility"},{"location":"zms_client/#zms-client-utility","text":"Overview Getting Software Prerequisites Getting Help Specifying ZMS Environments How the ZMS Client Authenticates Listing registered domains in Athenz Displaying Administrators for a Product Domain Adding Domains Parameters Examples Registering Personal Domains Adding and Removing Administrators Adding a Group Role Parameters Example Managing a Group Role Membership Parameters Example Adding a temporary Role Membership with expiration date Parameters Example Adding a Policy Parameters Example","title":"ZMS Client Utility"},{"location":"zms_client/#overview","text":"The ZMS client utility allows administrators to manage Athenz domains, to check domain details, create personal domains, and add other administrators.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"zms_client/#getting-software","text":"Download latest ZMS Client utility binary release from Maven Central : click on the Browse button, choose the latest version directory and then download the athenz-utils-<latest-version>-bin.tar.gz . $ tar xvfz athenz-utils-X.Y-bin.tar.gz","title":"Getting Software"},{"location":"zms_client/#prerequisites","text":"Before you can use the ZMS client utility, you need to have asked the Athenz administrators to create your top level domain.","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"zms_client/#getting-help","text":"The help argument for the utility will display all commands available through utility. $ zms-cli help To get additional details about a specific command: $ zms - cli help [ command ] For example, to get complete details on how to add a domain including examples: $ zms-cli help add-domain","title":"Getting Help"},{"location":"zms_client/#specifying-zms-environments","text":"Use the -z option to point to the required environment for executing commands. $ zms-cli -z https://zms-server.athenzcompany.com:4443/zms/v1 -d athenz show-domain","title":"Specifying ZMS Environments"},{"location":"zms_client/#how-the-zms-client-authenticates","text":"The Athenz ZMS server requires the user to provide its UserToken or use a User certificate and private key for MTLS to authenticate with ZMS (depending on the Principal Authority used).

The Access Token contains the set of roles (identified in the token as scopes) a client belongs to for a specified domain. So, when a client wants to access a resource, this client must obtain the appropriate Access Token from ZTS and use the token in the header of the subsequent HTTP client request. If enabled, the service will also return an ID Token if requested. ID Token identifies the authenticated principal for a given Athenz Service Identity. Support for accessing OAuth2 access/id tokens is based on Client Credentials authentication workflow as defined in RFC6749: The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework . Access/ID Token Request \u00b6 Request \u00b6 To request an access token from ZTS Server, the client will send a POST request with application/x-www-form-urlencoded content-type to /oauth2/token endpoint. The request body must contain the following parameters: grant_type : Value MUST be set to \"client_credentials\" scope : list of scopes/roles requested in the access token. The caller can either specify to include all roles the principal has access to in a specific domain (e.g. <domain-name>:domain) or ask for specific roles only (e.g. <domain-name>:role.<role1>). Scopes are separated by spaces. To request an ID token, the scope must include 'openid' and audience service name (e.g. <domain-name>:service.<service-name>). The domain name in id token request match the domain name in the access token scope. expires_in : requested expiry time for access token in seconds For example, when a principal requests an access token only for accessing demo domain and wants to include all roles it has access to in that domain, the request would be: POST /zts/v1/oauth2/token HTTP/1.1 Host: <zts-address> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded grant_type=client_credentials&scope=demo%3Adomain If the principal requests an access token only for accessing demo domain and wants to include readers and writers roles it has access to in that domain, the request would be: POST /zts/v1/oauth2/token HTTP/1.1 Host: <zts-address> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded grant_type=client_credentials&scope=demo%3Arole.readers+sherpa%3Arole.writers If the principal requests an access token along with an id token for accessing demo domain for backend service and wants to include readers and writers roles it has access to in that domain, the request would be: POST /zts/v1/oauth2/token HTTP/1.1 Host: <zts-address> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded grant_type=client_credentials&scope=openid+demo%3Aservice.backend+demo%3Arole.readers+demo%3Arole.writers Response \u00b6 If the access token request is valid and authorized, the ZTS server issues an access token (and id token if requested). The response contains the following json document: { \"access_token\":\"<generated-token>\", \"id_token\":\"<generated-token>\", \"token_type\":\"Bearer\", \"expires_in\":3600 } Access Token format \u00b6 An access token is a JSON web token (JWT) encoded in Base64 URL-encoded format that contains a header, payload, and signature. An application server can authorize the principal to access specific resources based on the scopes (roles) defined in the access token. Access Token Header \u00b6 The Access token header contains the Athenz ZTS Server Private key id and the algorithm used to sign the payload. { \"alg\": \"ES256\", \"kid\": \"<zts server private key id>\" } Access Token Payload \u00b6 The Access Token Payload contains the following claims: ver : version of the access token iss : token issuer aud : the audience (the Athenz Domain name) that the access token is intended for uid : unique identifier for the principal (same as client Id) sub : subject of the access token (same as client Id) iat : token issue time in seconds (Unix time) exp : token expiry time in seconds (Unix time) scp : array of scopes are granted to this access token. This is the list of roles that principal can assume in the audience domain client_id : client ID (Athenz Principal) of the client that requested the access token Here is an example of an access token that alpha.api retrieved to access some resource in beta domain. The principal alpha.api is authorized to assume readers and writers roles in the beta domain. { \"ver\": 1, \"iss\": \"athenz\", \"aud\": \"beta\", \"client_id\": \"alpha.api\", \"uid\": \"alpha.api\", \"sub\": \"alpha.api\", \"iat\": 1554491974, \"exp\": 1554495574, \"scp\": [ \"readers\", \"writers\" ] } Access Token Validation \u00b6 You can use any standards based JWT library to validate the access token generated by ZTS Server. You can also implement your own verifier by following the RFC7519: Section 7.2: Validating a JWT . ID Token format \u00b6 An ID token is a JSON web token (JWT) encoded in Base64 URL-encoded format that contains a header, payload, and signature. The ID token, if enabled, can be issued for clients to authenticate themselves along with their access token to the requested Athenz service. ZTS Server never issues ID Tokens on its own. They're always returned along with access tokens. ID Token Header \u00b6 The ID token header contains the Athenz ZTS Server Private key id and the algorithm used to sign the payload. { \"alg\": \"ES256\", \"kid\": \"<zts server private key id>\" } ID Token Payload \u00b6 The ID Token Payload contains the following claims: ver : version of the id token iss : token issuer aud : the audience (the Athenz Service name) that the id token is intended for sub : subject of the id token - athenz pricnipal name requesting the token iat : token issue time in seconds (Unix time) exp : token expiry time in seconds (Unix time) auth_time: authentication time in seconds (Unix time) Here is an example of an id token that alpha.api retrieved for its authorization request to beta.backend service. { \"ver\": 1, \"iss\": \"athenz\", \"aud\": \"beta.backend\", \"sub\": \"alpha.api\", \"iat\": 1554491974, \"auth_time\": 1554491974, \"exp\": 1554495574 } ID Token Validation \u00b6 You can use any standards based JWT library to validate the id token generated by ZTS Server. You can also implement your own verifier by following the RFC7519: Section 7.2: Validating a JWT . Fetching Access Tokens with Java Client Library \u00b6 First you need to update your Java project pom.xml file to indicate the dependency on the Athenz zts java client library. Checkout the Maven Central ZTS Java Client Package page to make sure you're using the latest release version (You must use 1.8.37 or newer version of the client library). ZTS Client Object \u00b6 ZTS Client Library provides several constructors. The recommended approach is to use an SSL context that includes service's Athenz issued CA certificate. ZTSClient object must be closed to release any allocated resources. ZTSClient class implements Closeable interface. However, to correctly handle auto-refresh of access tokens, the client used to fetch the token cannot be closed since the background tasks need to use the same client to refresh the access token. Our general recommendation is that you create a single ZTSClient object and use that for all requests (it is thread safe) and then close the client when your application is shutting down. ** Important ** During the shutdown of the application, ZTSClient.cancelPrefetch() must be called to stop the timer thread that automatically fetches and refreshes any cached tokens in the ZTS Client. Athenz Issued CA certificate \u00b6 You will need to provide the ZTSClient with the ZTS Server's URL and an SSLContext. The following examples will show how to generate an SSLContext /** * Constructs a new ZTSClient object with the given SSLContext object * and ZTS Server Url. Default read and connect timeout values are * 30000ms (30sec). The application can change these values by using the * athenz.zts.client.read_timeout and athenz.zts.client.connect_timeout * system properties. The values specified for timeouts must be in milliseconds. * @param ztsUrl ZTS Server's URL * @param sslContext SSLContext that includes service's private key and x.509 certificate * for authenticating requests */ public ZTSClient ( String ztsUrl , SSLContext sslContext ); First update your pom.xml to include dependency on athenz-cert-refresher package which provides support to create a SSLContext object based on our private key and certificate: < dependency > < groupId > com . yahoo . athenz </ groupId > < artifactId > athenz - cert - refresher </ artifactId > < version > VERSION - NUMBER </ version > </ dependency > The SSLContext contains a KeyRefresher with the following arguments: - The service private key - The service public key - The path of the truststore containing the CA certificate - The password for the truststore containing the CA certificate For example: // Create our SSL Context object based on our private key and // certificate and jdk truststore KeyRefresher keyRefresher = Utils . generateKeyRefresher ( trustStorePath , trustStorePassword , certPath , keyPath ); SSLContext sslContext = Utils . buildSSLContext ( keyRefresher . getKeyManagerProxy (), keyRefresher . getTrustManagerProxy ()); keyRefresher . startup (); ZTSClient ztsClient = new ZTSClient ( ztsUrl , sslContext ); Obtaining an Access Token \u00b6 To obtain an Access Token, the application would use the following method from the ZTSClient class: /** * For the specified requester(user/service) return the corresponding Access Token that * includes the list of roles that the principal has access to in the specified domain * @param domainName name of the domain * @param roleNames (optional) only interested in roles with these names * @param expiryTime (optional) specifies that the returned Access must be * at least valid for specified number of seconds. Pass 0 to use * server default timeout. * @return ZTS generated Access Token Response object. ZTSClientException will be thrown in case of failure */ public AccessTokenResponse getAccessToken ( String domainName , List < String > roleNames , long expiryTime ); In the simplest case, the method only requires the caller to specify the domain that the application will be accessing. Thus, it needs an Access Token for that domain. For example, if the alpha.storage service identifier is trying to access a resource from a domain beta , then the API call to retrieve the access token valid for 4 hours would be the following: AccessTokenResponse tokenResponse = null ; try { tokenResponse = ztsClient . getAccessToken ( \"beta\" , null , 14400 ); } catch ( ZTSClientException ex ) { // log error using ex.getCode() and ex.getMessage() } final String accessToken = tokenResponse . getAccess_token (); Then the client will include the retrieved Access Token value as one of its headers when submitting its request to the provider service. Token Caching \u00b6 The ZTS Client Library automatically caches any tokens returned by the ZTS Server, so any subsequent requests for an Access Token for the same domain are fulfilled from the local cache as opposed to connecting to the ZTS Server every time. This provides better performance by reusing the same Access Token because they\u2019re valid for two hours by default. The client library will only return cached Access Tokens if they\u2019re valid for at least \u00bc of the requested timeout in minutes (default 30 minutes). Least Privilege Access \u00b6 By default, the method getAccess returns all the roles that the given service identity can access within a domain. The method, however, has the roleNames parameter that allow applications to request access tokens for specific roles within a domain. Thus, the server need only check and return an access token for the specified roles. For example, the service has access to several roles within the alpha domain but is only interested in two roles readers and searchers . With this use case, the api call would be: AccessTokenResponse tokenResponse = null ; List < String > roles = new ArrayList <> (); roles . add ( \"readers); roles.add(\" searchers \"); try { tokenResponse = ztsClient.getAccessToken(\" alpha \", roles, 14400); } catch (ZTSClientException ex) { // log error using ex.getCode() and ex.getMessage() } final String accessToken = tokenResponse.getAccess_token(); Command Line Utility to Fetch Access Tokens \u00b6 Athenz team also provides a command line utility called zts-accesstoken that can be used to fetch access/id tokens from the ZTS Server for a given domain and/or specific roles. $ zts-accesstoken -domain alpha.prod -service api -svc-key-file beta.api.key.pem -svc-cert-file beta.api.cert.pem -zts https://<zts-address>/zts/v1 Check out the zts-accesstoken user guide for full details. Troubleshooting \u00b6 When communicating with ZTS Server to obtain an Access Token, the ZTS Server will return the following 4xx error codes if it's unable to successfully process the request: 400 The domain name specified in the request to issue an access token is inconsistent with other scopes. 401 The request could not be successfully authenticated. 403 The service identity does not have access to any resources in the specified domain. 404 The domain specified in the request to issue an Access Token for does not exist.","title":"Obtaining OAuth2 Access Tokens from ZTS"},{"location":"zts_access_token_guide/#accessid-token-request","text":"","title":"Access/ID Token Request"},{"location":"zts_access_token_guide/#request","text":"To request an access token from ZTS Server, the client will send a POST request with application/x-www-form-urlencoded content-type to /oauth2/token endpoint.

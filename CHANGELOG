Athenz v1.11.0 Release / May 11, 2022
-------------------------------------

Due to the upcoming End of Community Support for Eclipse Jetty 9.4.x on June 1st, 2022,
starting with the 1.11.0 release, Athenz services and libraries are being upgraded to
use the latest Jetty 11.x release. This release also requires the use of JDK 11.x with
the jakarta namespace and jersey 3.x instead of JDK 8.x with javax namespace and jersey 2.x.

To avoid compatibility issues with jersey 3.x and applications already running with
jersey 2.x, Athenz team has decided to rewrite our java client code generators to
remove dependency on jax-rs and jersey. Instead, the ZMS and ZTS java clients now
have a direct dependency on Apache Http Client (in the 1.10.x the clients were still
using the Jersey Apache Connectors). Unfortunately, these changes introduce a couple
of backward incompatible changes in the 1.11.x release so when upgrading your clients
to the latest release, make sure to review your code and make the necessary changes.

The following is the list of all changes that are introduced in the 1.11.x release:

- The ZMS, ZTS and ZPE java clients are built and require JDK 11. JDK 8.x is only
  supported in the 1.10.x release which will continue to be supported. However,
  new versions of the 1.10.x will only be released to address bug fixes or security issues.
- ZTS java client (artifact id: athenz-zts-java-client) is NO longer a shaded library.
  If you’re deploying the ZTS java client as part of your application, make sure you
  deploy all of its required dependencies.
- ZTS java core/non-shaded client (artifact id: athenz-zts-java-client-core) has been
  removed. You can just replace your dependency with the standard ZTS client library
  (artifact id: athenz-zts-java-client) since it’s no longer a shaded package and
  provides the same functionality as the core package.
- The setProperty() and getClientBuilder() methods in both ZMS and ZTS client libraries
  have been removed since they were used to set the javax.ws.rs.client.Client properties
  and the clients no longer use the jax-rs clients.

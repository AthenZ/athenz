# SIA for AWS EC2

## Configuration

SIA AWS requires a configuration file to be present in the /etc/sia/sia_config with the
following required attributes if the property does not want to use the default settings
which require the use of the EC2 instance-profile role in the name format of
`<property-domain-name>.<property-service-name>-service`:

```json
{
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "service": "property-service-name",
    "accounts": [
        {
            "domain":  "property-domain-name",
            "account": "account-aws-id"
        }
    ]
}
```

The AWS Account administrator must create an IAM Role called
'<property-domain-name>.<property-service-name>" and this role must be setup
with a trusted relationship with the role that the EC2 instance is
configured to run as.

SIA Configuration file is also required if the user wants to change the default
user/group settings that the private key is owned by. By default, the private key
is owned by user `root` and readable by group `athenz`. If the user wants to
provide access to their service identity private key to another user, it can
be accomplished by adding the user to the group `athenz`. If the user wants to
change the user and group values, a config file must be dropped with the following
optional fields:

```json
{
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "service": "property-service-name",
    "accounts": [
        {
            "domain":  "property-domain-name",
            "account": "account-aws-id",
            "user": "unix-username",
            "group": "unix-groupname"
        }
    ]
}
```

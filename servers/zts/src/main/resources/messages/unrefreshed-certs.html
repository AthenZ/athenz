            <br>Please review this list and take one of the following actions:
            <br>
            <p> 1. Login to the host and verify that sia is able to successfully refresh identity certificates.
            Address any issues that are reported during the certificate refresh request.</p>
            <p> 2. After verifying that if the host certificate record is no longer valid due to this
            instance being re-bootstrapped or changed identity, please delete the
            certificate record by running the following command (using your domain administrator credentials):</p>
            <b>curl --key &lt;KEY&gt; --cert &lt;CERT&gt; -X DELETE https://{4}/zts/v1/instance/{5}/{6}/{7}/{8} </b>
            <p>Important: Once the certificate record is deleted, the instance will not be able to
            refresh its certificates so make sure the record is no longer needed.</p>
            <p> 3. If you already have monitoring in place for unrefreshed certificates, you may disable unrefreshed
            certificate notifications by adding the following domain tag:</p>
            <p>Tag: <b>zts.DisableCertRefreshNotifications</b> Value: <b>true</b></p>

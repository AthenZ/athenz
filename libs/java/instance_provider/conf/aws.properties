# This file contains AWS Instance Provider properties for Athenz ZTS server.

# ZTS AWS region name
#athenz.zts.aws_region_name

# For ZTS running within AWS we need to validate the host identity document
# before we issue a TLS certificate for a service identified by its IAM role,
# the server verifies that the instance was booted within the configured number
# of seconds. Default: 5 minutes (300 seconds)
#athenz.zts.aws_boot_time_offset=300

# For ZTS running in AWS, this setting specifies path a file that includes
# the AWS Public certificate that is needed to verify host identity documents
# provided by AWS. For any regions not using the default AWS Public certificate,
# the athenz.zts.aws_public_cert_per_region property must be used to specify
# the path to the certificate for that region.
#athenz.zts.aws_public_cert=
#athenz.zts.aws_public_cert_per_region=

# For ZTS running within AWS, this setting specifies the DNS suffix
# that the AWS provider will use to validate all hostnames in the CSR
#athenz.zts.aws_dns_suffix=

# Support K8S dns suffixes generated based on k8s dns spec. the sanDNS entries with
# the specified list of suffixes will not be required to include the athenz
# domain/service components. For example, some valid suffix values could be:
# svc.cluster.local,pod.cluster.local
#athenz.zts.aws_eks_dns_suffix=

# List of valid AWS EKS cluster names that the ZTS server will accept
# when processing CSR requests.
#athenz.zts.aws_eks_cluster_names

# Specifies the maximum number of days that the issued TLS certificate
# will be valid for without a signed instance identity document (only
# based on valid IAM temporary credentials). The default value is 7 days.
#athenz.zts.aws_cert_validity_sts_only=7

# Specifies whether the provider must validate the IP addresses included in the
# certificate signing request. If set to true, then the server will
# validate the IP addresses in the CSR against the private IP address
# of the instance as well as the list of allowed IP addresses specified
# in the athenz.zts.aws_allowed_ip_addresses property. The list of allowed
# IP addresses is a comma separated list of IPv4 CIDR ranges. For example:
# 10.0.0.0/8,192.168.0.0/16,172.16.0.0/12
#athenz.zts.aws_validate_ip_address=false
#athenz.zts.aws_allowed_ip_addresses=

# This file contains GCP Instance Provider properties for Athenz ZTS server.

# ZTS GCP region name
#athenz.zts.gcp_region_name

# For ZTS running within GCP we need to validate issued token before we issue
# a TLS certificate for a service. The server verifies that the instance was
# booted within the configured number of seconds. Default: 5 minutes (300 seconds)
#athenz.zts.gcp_boot_time_offset=300

# For ZTS running within GCP, this setting specifies the DNS suffix
# that the GCP provider will use to validate all hostnames in the CSR
#athenz.zts.gcp_dns_suffix=

# Support K8S dns suffixes generated based on k8s dns spec. the sanDNS entries with
# the specified list of suffixes will not be required to include the athenz
# domain/service components. For example, some valid suffix values could be:
# svc.cluster.local,pod.cluster.local
#athenz.zts.gcp_gke_dns_suffix=

# List of valid GCP GKE cluster names that the ZTS server will accept
# when processing CSR requests.
#athenz.zts.gcp_gke_cluster_names

# Specifies the maximum number of days that the issued TLS certificate
# will be valid for. The default value is 7 days.
#athenz.zts.gcp_cert_validity=7

# Specifies whether the provider must validate the IP addresses included in the
# certificate signing request. If set to true, then the server will
# validate the IP addresses in the CSR against the private IP address
# of the instance as well as the list of allowed IP addresses specified
# in the athenz.zts.gcp_allowed_ip_addresses property. The list of allowed
# IP addresses is a comma separated list of IPv4 CIDR ranges. For example:
# 10.0.0.0/8,192.168.0.0/16,172.16.0.0/12
#athenz.zts.gcp_validate_ip_address=false
#athenz.zts.gcp_allowed_ip_addresses=

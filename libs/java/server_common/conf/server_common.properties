# The file contains system properties for Athenz server-common module.

# This property specifies the name of the histogram metric that will be used to
# record the latency in milliseconds for each API request. The default value is
# 'athenz_api_request_duration_msecs'. You can override this value to provide
# a different name for the histogram metric.
athenz.otel_histogram_name=athenz_api_request_duration_msecs

# This property specifies whether to separate metrics by Athenz domain name.
# By default, only a single metric is recorded where the request and principal
# domain names are specified as labels along with the API name, http status code.
# and the http method. With this default behavior the cardinality of the metrics
# could result in a large number of time series which could be difficult to manage.
# By setting this property to true, 3 metrics are generated and reported:
# {metric-name}_requestDomain - only contains a single attribute - requestDomainName
# {metric-name}_principalDomain - only contains a single attribute - principalDomainName
# {metric-name} - contains 3 attributes, httpMethod, apiName and httpStatusCode
# This will significantly reduce the cardinality of the metrics recorded.
# The default value is false.
athenz.otel_separate_domain_metrics=false
